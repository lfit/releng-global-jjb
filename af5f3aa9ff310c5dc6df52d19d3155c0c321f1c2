      "message": "Are we missing a cd jjb/global-jjb here? because all the ../.. seems to assume that we\u0027re already in the jjb/global-jjb dir. Howeve the last argument seems to suggest we\u0027re not which seems to be conflicting information.\n\nI think there\u0027s 2 paths here:\n\n1) Assume we\u0027re in the jjb/global-jjb directory:\n\n cd jjb/global-jjb\n ln -s ../../global-jjb/jenkins-init-scripts .\n ln -s ../../global-jjb/shell .\n ln -s ../../global-jjb/jjb .\n\n2) Assume we\u0027re not in the jjb/global-jjb directory:\n\n ln -s global-jjb/jenkins-init-scripts jjb/global-jjb\n ln -s global-jjb/shell jjb/global-jjb\n ln -s global-jjb/jjb jjb/global-jjb\n\nI could be wrong, so double check. Also dropping the final directory path in the final arguments make the command a little shorter since ln will create the link with the same name as arg1.",
