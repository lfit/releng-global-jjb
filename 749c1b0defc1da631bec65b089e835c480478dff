In particular the common block for lf-rtd-verify uses a single variable to control voting:\n\nLine 172: gerrit-skip-vote: false\n\nthen that variable is used for all the skip-vote options\n\nI think it\u0027s easier to do this with a single toggle since you\u0027re going to want voting, or not want voting. I can\u0027t think of a single time where we wanted to only enable voting for one build case.",
