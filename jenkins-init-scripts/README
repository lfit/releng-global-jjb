The files in this directory are for initializing a Jenkins minion just before
the cloud plugin hands the minion over to Jenkins.

init.sh is the entry point script which then calls all other scripts.

init.sh also provides a local init script entry point by checking for the
existance of the file CIMAN_ROOT/jenkins-init-scripts/local-init.sh. If this
file exists it can be used to further customize the server node before handing
it to Jenkins for job use.

To use this create a managed file in Jenkins with the contents:

    #!/bin/bash
    git clone --recurse-submouldes https://gerrit.example.org/r/ci-management.git /opt/ciman
    /opt/ciman/jjb/global-jjb/jenkins-init-scripts/init.sh
