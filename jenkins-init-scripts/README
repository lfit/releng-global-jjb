The files in this directory are for initializing a Jenkins minion just
before the cloud plugin hands the minion over to Jenkins.

The Jenkins 'init.sh' script will check for a project specific init
script: '\$ciman_root/jenkins-init-scripts/local-init.sh'. If the file
exits and is executable, it will be executed. Note the local init
script will be executed before the 'jenkins' user has been created.
You can also call a project specific script from the Jenkins Manged
File after the call to 'init.sh'.

To use this create a Jenkins Managed File with the contents:

    #!/bin/bash

    exec > /var/log/jenkins-init.log 2>&1

    gerrit_host=gerrit.example.org
    ciman_root=/opt/ciman

    until host $gerrit_host &>/dev/null ; do
        echo "Waiting until $gerrit_host is resolvable..."
        sleep 1
    done

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://$gerrit_host/r/ci-management $ciman_root

    # Specify swapspace on the minion
    # SWAP_SIZE specifies the size of swapspace in GB If set to '0' no
    # swapspace will be allocated If unset, 1GB swapspace will be
    # allocated
    #export SWAP_SIZE=0

    $ciman_root/global-jjb/jenkins-init-scripts/init.sh

    rm -rf $ciman_root

    echo "jenkins-init: Done"
