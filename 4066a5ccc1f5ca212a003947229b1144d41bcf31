      "message": "Is fallocate supported on FS\u0027s/flvour? Afaik, this was only supported on extent based FS, like ext4, btrfs and xfs. It would be good to have a way to check if the FS support is available and then choose to call dd or fallocate, assuming in the future we have an arch/flavor/fs which might not have this available. Also would be useful if want these script to work with containers in near future.",
