      "message": "The intent is that some projects may have artifacts that don\u0027t get tagged at the same time as the release. The primary workflow looks like this (mostly an ONAP example)\n\nProject declares a release -\u003e tag of repo \u0026 release of java artifacts\nProject stages a container release -\u003e stage jobs run and pull released java artifacts into container\nProject declares container release -\u003e job executes and is flagged as don\u0027t tag, it _skips_ this because otherwise it would exit the script before doing any other work since it is already tagged.\n\nGranted the example I just gave doesn\u0027t fully mesh with what you\u0027re seeing here, but the intent for it is the same. Some projects actually have several different artifacts being built in different reactors out of the same project (but different jobs). So they need to tag at a given point in time, but only _one_ of the reactor jobs can actually do the tagging. We need to give them a way to determine which is their lead / fully tagging job, and which is just the artifact release job(s).",
