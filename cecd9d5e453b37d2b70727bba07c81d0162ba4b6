Allowing it would prevent the parent process from passing args to MVN that contain IFS chars, but I don\u0027t see the upside of that (other than not having see \u0027\"\u0027 everywhere).\n\nWe have complete control over the MAVEN_* variables so I understand why we might not need to worry about \u0027word splitting\u0027.
