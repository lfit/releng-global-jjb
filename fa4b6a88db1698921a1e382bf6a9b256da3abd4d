Considering it\u0027s not as simple as just renaming the managed file as the macro also needs to be changed. I think the release notes would benefit from more step instructions. I see at least a couple of changes that need to happen here for a successful upgrade:\n\n 1. All instances if lf-infra-jjbini-sandbox macros need to now be replaced with lf-infra-jjbini\n 2. Configuration of jjbini-sandbox Managed File now needs to be imported into jjbini Managed File under a named config section like:\n    [sandbox]\n    ... config details ...\n 3. jjbini-sandbox Managed File can be deleted",
