Notable changes since v0.12.0

GitHub job builders now reference $sha1 instead of refs/heads/$branch.

92c2494 Thanh Ha        Migrate Maven Merge job to global-jjb
Maven Merge jobs are now migrated to global-jjb. This new job has some
significant changes since the last release so is not automatically included in
the Maven job group in this release. We plan to fully test this in ODL first
before moving it into the job group.
