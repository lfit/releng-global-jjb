global-jjb v0.9.0 Release Notes
===============================

Thanks to Jeremy and Thanh for contributing to this release.

Notable changes since v0.8.0
----------------------------

859c2a8 Jeremy Phelps   Add timed parameter to lf-maven-release anchor
The maven-release job now has a 'cron' configuration allowing projects to set
the job to run via a schedule if needed. The cron configuration supports
passing more than 1 line of cron items via the YAML pipe | character.

add619c Thanh Ha        Add maven-javadoc jobs
New maven-javadoc jobs will run `javadoc:aggregate` against projects to
generate javadocs for the project. The verify jobs store a copy of the docs on
the log server so that they can more easily be reviewed. The merge job will
push these docs to Nexus in the javadoc repository.

74befe2 Thanh Ha        Run tox envs separately and capture logs
Tox jobs now will run all the tox envs in parallel and report back a summary.
Each individual env run is additionally stored in the log server as
'tox-$env.log' for further inspection if needed. We're hoping this will speed
up tox builds moving forward.

4d5dfa5 Thanh Ha        Add job to deploy to sandbox
New job will allow ci-management contributors to push JJB patches to Gerrit and
then via Gerrit comment keyword push jobs that they wish to test in the sandbox
using `jjb-deploy JOB_NAME` where JOB_NAME is the name of the job that should
be pushed to the sandbox. You can also use wildcards like 'project-merge-*' to
push all jobs that start with the name project-merge- to the sandbox.

11b2f87 Thanh Ha        Add trigger for launching release job via comment
The release job can now be triggered via the `build release` keyword in a
Gerrit Comment.

df6bd25 Thanh Ha        Create job to lock|unlock branches via Gerrit
New gerrit-branch-lock job will generate a patch to lock or unlock a Gerrit
branch. The job can be triggered by leaving a Gerrit comment of `lock branch`
or `unlock branch`. Committers on the project will still need to make the final
decision on whether or not to merge the patch.
