global-jjb v0.24.0 Release Notes
================================

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

maven-stage job was renamed to maven-release to more align with what it
actually does.


Notable changes since v0.23.0
-----------------------------

ab9889f Jessica Wagantall       Update CLM job to use Nexus Policy Evaluation
Nexus CLM jobs were updated to work with the Nexus Platform Plugin in Jenkins.
The older Sonatype CLM plugin is no longer supported.

893eeb3 Thanh Ha        Add CMake Stage job
Add CMake staging job for c/c++ projects to use. This job pushes artifacts
to a Nexus Staging repository.

32363c6 Thanh Ha        Rename maven-release job to maven-stage
The maven-release job was renamed to maven-stage to more align with that it
actually does. We will use maven-release to do a real release in the future.

1eda455 Thanh Ha        Add Jenkins Sandbox Cleanup job
New cron job that can run regularly to cleanup the Sandbox system of jobs and
views. This was done via backend cron task on the system itself however this
new job gives more visibility.

9cb04c8 Thanh Ha        Add option to disable-job for all jobs
New option "disable-job" is now available for all global-jjb jobs allowing
projects to disable jobs.

b3c4fef Thanh Ha        Add pre-build step to prep vm before build
New pre-build macro available which will be used in the future to run
preparation scripts before starting the job run. For example installing
extra dependencies.
