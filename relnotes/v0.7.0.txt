global-jjb v0.7.0 Release Notes
===============================

Thanks to Anil, and Thanh for contributing to this release.

Upgrade considerations
----------------------

1. lftools-version MUST be configured in defaults.yaml
   Example: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/62005
2. lf-infra-deploy-maven-file marco has backwards incompatible changes and
   needs to be modified to


Notable changes since v0.6.0
----------------------------

abd2795 Thanh Ha        Verify JJB when global-jjb is updated
Project's own jjb tests will now also run validation when a patch to upgrade
global-jjb is submitted.

ec0a666 Thanh Ha        Add default refspec reference
Bug made refspec not configurable. It is now configurable and defaults to the
branch that the job is configured for.

6c848c0 Thanh Ha        Migrate Maven Verify job template
The Maven Verify job template is now available in global-jjb. We used the
OpenDaylight project's version as a basis for this new template.

05a16f0 Thanh Ha        Make Merge and Verify job triggers overrideable
Merge and Verify job triggers are now overrideable in project definitions in
cases where a project might have a topic branch for which they want to have
a different triggering mechanism.

687da40 Thanh Ha        Make lftools version configurable
global-jjb now requires that lftools-version be configured in the project's
defaults.yaml.

cee8201 Thanh Ha        Refactor tests into jjb-tests directory
Global-JJB now has tests that check the expected xml to ensure that
configuration changes which might affect end users are caught and noted.

40a8db9 Anil Belur      Generalize deploy maven-file builder
Updates the maven-file command to support file:// paths in addition to http://
paths.
