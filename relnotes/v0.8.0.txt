global-jjb v0.8.0 Release Notes
===============================

Thanks to Anil, Jeremy, and Thanh for contributing to this release.

Notable changes since v0.7.0
----------------------------

1c6c45e Jeremy Phelps   Generalize odl rtd jobs for global-jjb
Read The Docs jobs have been migrated to global-jjb for easy use across
projects.

f48fc39 Thanh Ha        Add update-expected-xml call
New tox command `tox -e update-expected-xml` will automatically update the
xml in .jjb-test making it easier for developers to update these files.

3eafac9 Thanh Ha        Add lf-pip-install macro to handle pypi packages
New `lf-pip-install` macro is now available which will handle the installation
of pypi packages. This is code that was copy pasted in many places but is now
consolidated into a single macro making it easier to perform. Scripts may need
to be updated to `source /path/to/virtualenv` when migrating to this macro.
The name of the first pypi package listed in the macro will be used as the
virtualenv name when creating the virtualenv in /tmp/v/NAME

7f77f1f Thanh Ha        Migrate sonar job
The Sonar job is now migrated to global-jjb allowing projects to now take
advantage of this shared job.
