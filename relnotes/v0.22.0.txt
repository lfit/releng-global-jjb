for contributing to this release.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

None.


Notable changes since v0.21.0
-----------------------------

46d1da1 Thanh Ha        Pull default USER_DATA_ID from cloud.cfg
38f7e0e Thanh Ha        Pull default KEY_PAIR_NAME from cloud.cfg
USER_DATA_ID and KEY_PAIR_NAME defaults are now first pulled from cloud.cfg
and then finally a fallback to the function definition. For these settings
it is expected that if a minion template does not define one that it first
falls back on the definition in cloud.cfg and was a cause of confusion when it
did not.

092d315 Thanh Ha        Add support for JNLP based minions
JNLP based minion support has been added to jenkins-cfg management. This allows
Windows minions to now be managed by the jenkins-cfg job.

a97f48e Aric Gardner    Support recheck and reverify in global-jjb
Adds more strict checking of Gerrit Triggers and allow the use of both
"recheck" and "reverify" as keywords for triggering verify jobs as some
consumers of global-jjb either keywords or both.

We recommended downstream projects to also implement the same feature as well
in their own ci-management repos to keep consistency across projects.

50385bf Thanh Ha        Fix missing parameters in tox-verify job
tox-verify job was missing the PARALLEL parameter causing issues with
tox-verify jobs caused by the v0.19.0 release.

bbaf6b5 Thanh Ha        Add license check job using new lhc
New license-checker job is now available for scanning code paths for license
header violations.

0218d6c Thanh Ha        Add support for OS Plugin v2.35

5589ae7 Luis Gomez      Change project to clone by jjb-deploy
jjb-deploy can now be run from any project Gerrit patch. When run from a
ci-management one, it will deploy from the proposed patch. When run from a
non-ci-management repo, it will deploy from latest ci-mamagenement master
branch.
