global-jjb v0.18.0 Release Notes
================================

Thanks to Anil, Jeremy, Jessica, Ry, and Thanh for contributing to this release.


Upgrade considerations
----------------------

1. PostBuildScript 2.x support

This release updates some macros that requires the PostBuildScript 2.0 plugin
or newer to be installed in Jenkins and JJB 2.0.3 or newer to be installed for
the jjb-verify and jjb-merge jobs.

2. ReadTheDocs (RTD) merge job updated for RTD v2 API

The rtd-merge now replaces the previous ``rtd-project`` parameter with 2 new
parameters ``rtd-build-url`` and ``rtd-token``. This is to support the newer
RTD v2 API which no longer allows anonymous triggering of builds in RTD.

Refer to the rtd-merge job documentation for details:
http://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/projects/global-jjb/en/latest/jjb/lf-rtd-jobs.html#readthedocs-merge


Notable changes since v0.17.0
-----------------------------

f76c82a Thanh Ha        Support PostBuildScript 2.x
PostBuildScript 2.x in Jenkins is now supported by global-jjb allowing us to
move off of the older and no longer supported 1.x release of the plugin.

841f374 Thanh Ha        Add support for VolumeFromImage boot source
The OpenStack cloud plugin version 2.32 adds support for allowing us to set
the volume size of a minion from the plugin. global-jjb now supports this as
well via the jenkins-cfg job.

Refer to the jenkins-cfg job documentation for full details:
http://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/projects/global-jjb/en/latest/jjb/lf-ci-jobs.html#jenkins-configuration-merge

ad0ee7c Ry Jones        Fix pip version to 9.0.3
We now pin all global-jjb pip dependencies to version 9.0.3 as upstream's
latest 10.0.0 release is a major change that breaks several of our jobs.

b020128 Jeremy Phelps   Update RTD to use Generic API v2 webhook
Adds support for RTD's Generic API v2 which no longer allows anonymous build
triggering and requires a build url + token for each project.

d859830 Jessica Wagantall       Add lf_tox_sonar job
Adds a python-sonar job that can be used by Python projects to generate sonar
reports.

379003e Jessica Wagantall       Update comment triggers XC CLM
Python CLM triggers were changed to "run-clm" to match existing similar jobs.
