This does install an updated version of \u0027virtualenv\u0027 in the \u0027user\u0027 venv. But when you access it from tox-run the \u0027-l\u0027 is used which adds ~/.local/bin to the END of the PATH the first \u0027virtualenv\u0027 in the PATH will be the system one. I validated this by adding a \u0027type virtualenv\u0027 to tox-run.sh. It also might be getting \u0027virtualenv\u0027 from /opt/pyenv/bin.",
