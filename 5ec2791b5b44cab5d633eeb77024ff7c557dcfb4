      "message": "I sort of agree that we need to start packing tools more into the images and validating via the ansible in some fashion.\n\nWe haven\u0027t done this historically because of the bloated size of the images, but with all the extra emphasis on more secure builds we may just have to deal with that. The biggest issue with baking it though is that it means having to rebuild the image if a new version is needed. That\u0027s always been the major tradeoff.",

      "message": "Agreed, but nowadays the speed at which we move global-jjb is rather slow and having an image rebuild in between is not that much of the issue (once a feature is stable).\n\nA further argument is that lf-activate-venv is taking minutes to execute -- and in ODL we have jobs which complete in under 10 minutes -- see https://s3-logs.opendaylight.org/logs/releng/vex-yul-odl-jenkins-1/infrautils-maven-merge-master/679/console-timestamp.log.gz for an example.",
