      "message": "I think this code won\u0027t achieve what you\u0027re intending. I believe the intent is to have tox read TOX_OPTIONS_LIST and pass everything as a set of parameters to the tox command however what this code here will result in is a single parameter with the entire list as a string. So\n\nexpected: tox --parallel auto --parallel-live \nactual: tox \"--parallel auto --parallel-live\"\n\nInstead I think what we should use is an array. Refer to https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Sc2086 and jump to the exceptions section where it has an example of how to pass CLI parameters.",
