Consider: Script 1 creates venv \"3\" and calls your fn to add package P at version 1.0.1.  Script 2 comes along in the same build, reuses venv \"3\" and calls your fn to add package P at version 1.0.2.  You say this is an error!?   That would be a difficult situation.",

      "message": "The primary reason for a \u0027shared\u0027 venv is to better control the packages versions across all jobs. We don\u0027t want everyone installing different versions of packages. My assumption is that in the general case, if a package needs to be tied to a version, it should always be installed (like jenkins-job-builder). Past that point all versions of packages is driven by \u0027pip --update\u0027. If you were to try to install jenkins-job-builder with any version other than 2.8.0, \u0027pip\u0027 will give an error. If we want to support everyone \u0027doing their own thing\u0027 we could, but that is s different approach: \u0027lf-venv-tmp-create()\u0027.\n\nI am currently looking at situation where they want to install \u0027lftools\u0027 from a source repo (using setup.py). I don\u0027t think we want a \u0027special version\u0027 of \u0027lftools\u0027 installed in a shared venv, That should be installed in a temp venv that is not shared.",

      "message": "I considered doing that and it would be easy to just ask pip what is already installed. It would also catch the case where \u0027b\u0027 got installed only because it was a dependency of \u0027a\u0027. With the current implementation, it would install \u0027b\u0027 again.\nI was concerned about the time it would take to search a much longer list of packages. If you install all the packages it can approache 100. Given the efficient process I am using to search, it would probably not be a problem. It would allow me to discard a global variable: \u0027_lf_existing_pkgs\u0027 Note the search would still have to be performed even if lf-venv-create() has nothing to do and will just be returning.",
