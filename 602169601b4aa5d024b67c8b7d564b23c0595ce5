      "message": "It\u0027s not a deprecation if we\u0027ve removed it outright. Typically API get\u0027s marked as deprecated in a minor release and then fully removed in a major release.\n\nFor example:\n\n1.1.0 (Mark Deprecated API)\n2.0.0 (Remove all APIs marked deprecated)\n\nAccording to this patch the jjbini sandbox API is completely removed in which case I think marking it as deprecated is an incorrect category here and instead we should be using the \"upgrade\" category to notify users that they MUST switch to the new JJB 2.0 format.",
