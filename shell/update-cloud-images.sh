# Auto-update packer image{s} when the job is started manually or a single
# image passed by upstream packer merge job:
# 1. Get a list of image{s} from the releng/builder repository
# 2. Search openstack cloud for the latest image{s} available or use the image
#    name passed down from the upstream job.
# 3. Compare the time stamps of the new image{s} with the image in use
# 4. Update the image{s} in the config files and yaml files
# 5. Push the change to Gerrit
