# This script will be run on the Nexus Server for each project.  Typically each
# project will have multiple nexus silos. This script will find all the job cost
# files (job_name/job_num/cost.csv) in each silo and append them to the annual
# cost file (~nexus/cost/$silo.YYYY.csv~nexus/bin . It will then delete all the
# job cost files.

# Because this file meant to be run by cron, I have restricted normal info
# logging messages on a single line. Error may be multi-line.
#
# Each cost file contains one or more CSV records in the following format:
#
#   JobName , BuildNumber , Date , InstanceType , Uptime , Cost , StackCost
#
#   Date format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
#   Cost format: '%.2f' (1.29)

#
#  Testing/Validation
#
#  You can validate this script by running as yourself on the Nexus server. You
#  should not have write permission anywhere in the Silo Directory. The
#  Silo Cost File from your test will be created/updated in:
#      ~/cost/$silo-$year.csv. If you run multiple times, duplicate records
#      will be created.
#
#  To enable debug set envionment variable DEBUG=true. If this is done on the
#  command-line, you  do not have to edit this file.
debug=${DEBUG:-false}
