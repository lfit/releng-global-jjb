Let\u0027s make this patch docker-releases exclusive. \nI want to suggest isolating the following in a separate patch that we can get merged sooner:\n- Fix to schema/release-schema.yaml\n- The introduction of macro lf-build-with-parameters-maven-release for maven releases.\n- Fixes to the triggers\n\nThat way we can have smaller changes merged and tested.. Let me help you breaking the fixes down in separate patches.",
