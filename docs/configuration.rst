    use for ssh connections. (ex: jenkins-ssh)

default configurations for certain tools. This section details the files to
define in Jenkins' **Manage Files** configuration.

This file contains default npmrc configuration and lives in $HOME/.npmrc.
Documentation for npmrc is available via the `npm project
<https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc>`_.

:Required: This file MUST exist. An empty file is acceptable if a
    proxy is not available for the project.
:type: Custom file

Create a "Custom file" with contents:

.. code::

   registry = https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/npmjs/

pipconf

This file contains default configuration for the python-pip tool and lives
in $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf. Documentation for pip.conf is available via the

**jenkins-log-archives-settings** with a server ID of **logs** containing the
credentials for the logs user in Nexus.
