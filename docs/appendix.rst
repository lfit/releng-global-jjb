ShellCheck
==========

When using ShellCheck to lint global-jjb or any projects that include
global-jjb as part of their project (common with ci-management repos) then
we require version 0.4.x of ShellCheck installed on the build vms. This version
introduces annotations used by shell scripts in this repo.
