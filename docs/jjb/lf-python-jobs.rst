Python XC CLM
-------------

CLM scans for Python based repos. This job will call the Nexus IQ CLI
directly to run the scans.

credentials.  The credential should contain the username and password
to access Nexus IQ Server.

    - {project-name}-python-clm-{stream}
    - gerrit-python-xc-clm
    - github-python-xc-clm

Python Sonar with Tox
---------------------

Sonar scans for Python based repos. This job invokes tox to run tests
and gather coverage statistics from the test results, then invokes
Maven to publish the results to either a Sonar server or SonarCloud.

To get the Sonar coverage results, file tox.ini must exist and contain
coverage commands to run.

The coverage commands define the code that gets executed by the test
suites.  Checking coverage does not guarantee that the tests execute
properly, but it identifies code that is not executed by any test.

.. comment Start ignoring WriteGoodLintBear

This job reuses the Sonar builders used for Java/Maven projects which
run maven twice. The first invocation does nothing for Python
projects, so the job uses the goal 'validate' by default. The second
invocation publishes results using the goal 'sonar:sonar' by default.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    [testenv:py27]
    commands =
            coverage run --module pytest --junitxml xunit-results.xml
            coverage xml --omit=".tox/py27/*","tests/*"
            coverage report --omit=".tox/py27/*","tests/*"

PyPI Merge
----------

Creates and uploads distribution files on merge of a patch set. Runs
tox, builds a source distribution and (optionally) a binary
distribution, and uploads the distribution(s) to a PyPI repository.
The project git repository must have a setup.py file
with configuration for packaging the component.

This job should use a staging repository like testpypi.python.org,
which sets up use of release jobs to promote the distributions later.
This job can also use a public release area like the global PyPI
repository if the release process is not needed. These PyPI
repositories allow upload of a package at a specific version once,
they do not allow overwrite of a package.  This means that a merge job
will fail in the upload step if the package version already exists in
the target repository.

The tox runner is pyenv aware so if the image contains an installation
of pyenv at /opt/pyenv it will pick it up and run Python tests with
the appropriate Python versions. The tox runner sets the following
pyenv variables before running.

.. code:: bash

   export PYENV_ROOT="/opt/pyenv"
   export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"

Installable package projects should consider using a directory layout
like the one shown below. All Python files are below a directory, and
the package source files are nested in a subdirectory. This layout
allows straightforward build-job triggers using the directory paths so
Jenkins jobs are triggered appropriately. For example, a PyPI merge
job should not be triggered by a non-Python change, because the job
cannot upload the same package twice.

.. code-block:: bash

    │   └── index.rst

tokens. Note that in the [pypi] entry the repository key-value pair is
optional, it defaults to pypi.org.
