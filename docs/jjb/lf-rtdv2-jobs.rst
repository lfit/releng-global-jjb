##########################
ReadTheDocs Version:2 Jobs
##########################

This is a global job that only needs to be added once to your project's ci-mangement git repository. It leverages the read the docs v3 api to create projects on the fly, as well as set up subproject associations with the master doc.

The master doc must be defined in
jenkins-config/global-vars-{production|sandbox}.sh

examples:
global-vars-sandbox.sh:
MASTER_RTD_PROJECT=doc-test
global-vars-production.sh:
MASTER_RTD_PROJECT=doc

In this way sandbox jobs will create docs with a test suffix and will not stomp on production documentation.

Example job config:

example file: ci-management/jjb/rtd/rtd.yaml

.. code-block:: bash

    ---
    - project:
        name: rtdv2-verify-global
        build-node: centos7-builder-1c-1g
        jobs:
          - rtdv2-verify-global
        stream:
          - master:
              branch: master
          - foo:
              branch: stable/{stream}

    - project:
        name: rtdv2-merge-global
        build-node: centos7-builder-1c-1g
        jobs:
          - rtdv2-merge-global
        stream:
          - master:
              branch: master
          - foo:
              branch: stable/{stream}

Or add both jobs via a job group:


.. code-block:: bash

    ---
    - project:
        name: rtdv2-global
        build-node: centos7-builder-1c-1g
        jobs:
          - rtdv2-global
        stream:
          - master:
              branch: master


Github jobs must be per project, and will be covered by a diffrent set of jobs once these are proven.

Job requires an lftools config section, this is to provide api access to read the docs.

.. code-block:: bash

    [rtd]
    endpoint = https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/
    token = [hidden]

Merge Job will create a project on read the docs if none exist.
Merge Job will assign a project as a subproject of the master project.
Merge job will trigger a build to update docs.

Macros
======

lf-rtdv2-common
---------------

RTD verify and merge jobs are the same except for their scm, trigger, and
builders definition. This anchor is the common template.
