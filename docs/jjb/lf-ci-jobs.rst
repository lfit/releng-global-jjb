.. _jenkins-cfg-envvar:

Global Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Global Environment Variables are managed via the
``jenkins-config/global-vars-SILO.sh`` file in ci-management. Replace SILO with
the name of the Jenkins silo the variable configuration is for.

The format for this file is ``KEY=value`` for example::

    GERRIT_URL=https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit
    GIT_BASE=git://devvexx.opendaylight.org/mirror/$PROJECT
    GIT_URL=git://devvexx.opendaylight.org/mirror
    JENKINS_HOSTNAME=vex-yul-odl-jenkins-2
    LOGS_SERVER=https://logs.opendaylight.org
    NEXUS_URL=https://nexus.opendaylight.org
    ODLNEXUSPROXY=https://nexus.opendaylight.org
    SILO=sandbox
    SONAR_URL=https://sonar.opendaylight.org

Cloud Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration requires the OpenStack Cloud plugin in Jenkins and is
currently the only cloud plugin supported.

OpenStack Cloud plugin version supported:

* 2.30 - 2.34
* 2.35 - 2.37

Cloud configuration are managed via a directory structure in ci-management as
follows:

- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/cloud.cfg
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/centos7-builder-2c-2g.cfg
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/centos7-builder-4c-4g.cfg
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/centos7-docker-4c-4g.cfg

The directory name inside of the "openstack" directory is used as the name of
the cloud configuration. In this case "cattle" is being used as the cloud name.

The ``cloud.cfg`` file is a special file used to configure the main cloud
configuration in the format ``KEY=value``.

:Cloud Parameters:

    :CLOUD_URL: API endpoint URL for Keystone.
        (default: "")
    :CLOUD_IGNORE_SSL: Ignore unverified SSL certificates. (default: false)

    :SANDBOX_CAP: Total number of instances the cloud will allow to
        spin up. This applies to "sandbox" systems and overrides the
        INSTANCE_CAP setting. (default: null)

        entire cloud. (default: null)
    :SANDBOX_CAP: Total number of instances of this type that can be launched
        at one time. When defined in clouds.cfg it defines the total for the
