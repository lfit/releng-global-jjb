Macros
======

lf-jenkins-cfg-global-vars
--------------------------

Manages the Global Jenkins variables. This macro will clear all exist macros
in Jenkins and replaces them with the ones defined by the
ci-management/jenkins-config/global-vars-SILO.sh script.

.. note::

   Requires the jjbini file in Jenkins CFP to contain JJB 2.0 style
   config definitions for "production" and "sandbox" systems.

:Required parameters:

    :jenkins-silos: Space separated list of Jenkins silos to update
        configuration for as defined in ~/.config/jenkins_jobs/jenkins_jobs.ini

lf-infra-jjbini
---------------

Provides jenkins_jobs.ini configuration for Jenkins.

lf-infra-jjbini-sandbox
-----------------------

Provides jenkins_jobs.ini configuration for Jenkins sandbox.

.. todo:: This needs to be consolidated into lf-infra-jjbini when JJB 2.0 is available

lf-packer-common
----------------

Common packer configuration.

lf-packer-file-paths
--------------------

Gerrit file-paths for packer jobs.

lf-packer-parameters
--------------------

Parameters useful for packer related tasks.

:Parameters:

    :packer-version: Version of packer to install / use.
        (shell: PACKER_VERSION)

lf-packer-verify-file-paths
---------------------------

Gerrit file-paths for packer verify jobs.

Job Templates
=============

Gerrit Branch Lock
------------------

Job submits a patch to lock or unlock a project's branch.

:Template Names:
    - {project-name}-gerrit-branch-lock-{stream}
    - gerrit-branch-lock


.. _lf-global-jjb-jenkins-cfg-merge:

Jenkins Configuration Merge
---------------------------

Jenkins job to manage Global Jenkins configuration.

.. note::

   Requires the jjbini file in Jenkins CFP to contain JJB 2.0 style
   config definitions for "production" and "sandbox" systems.

:Template names:

    - {project-name}-jenkins-cfg-merge
    - gerrit-jenkins-cfg-merge
    - github-jenkins-cfg-merge

:Optional parameters:

    :branch: Git branch to build against. (default: master)
    :cron: How often to run the job on a cron schedule. (default: @daily)
    :git-url: URL to clone project from. (default: $GIT_URL/$GERRIT_PROJECT)
    :jenkins-silos: Space separated list of Jenkins silos to update
        configuration for as defined in ~/.config/jenkins_jobs/jenkins_jobs.ini
        (default: production sandbox)

Typically this template is automatically pulled in by the
"{project-name}-ci-jobs" job-group and does not need to be explicitly called if
the job group is being used.

Miniaml Example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../.jjb-test/lf-ci-jobs/jenkins-cfg-merge-minimal.yaml

Global Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Global Environment Variables are managed via the
``jenkins-config/global-vars-SILO.sh`` file in ci-management. Replace SILO with
the name of the Jenkins silo the variable configuration is for.

The format for this file is ``KEY=value`` for example::

    GERRIT_URL=https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit
    GIT_BASE=git://devvexx.opendaylight.org/mirror/$PROJECT
    GIT_URL=git://devvexx.opendaylight.org/mirror
    JENKINS_HOSTNAME=vex-yul-odl-jenkins-2
    LOGS_SERVER=https://logs.opendaylight.org
    NEXUS_URL=https://nexus.opendaylight.org
    ODLNEXUSPROXY=https://nexus.opendaylight.org
    SILO=sandbox
    SONAR_URL=https://sonar.opendaylight.org

Cloud Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration requires the OpenStack Cloud plugin in Jenkins and is
currently the only cloud plugin supported.

OpenStack Cloud plugin version supported:

* 2.30
* 2.31
* 2.32

Cloud configuration are managed via a directory structure in ci-management as
follows:

- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/cloud.cfg
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/centos7-builder-2c-2g.cfg
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/centos7-builder-4c-4g.cfg
- jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/cattle/centos7-docker-4c-4g.cfg

The directory name inside of the "openstack" directory is used as the name of
the cloud configuration. In this case "cattle" is being used as the cloud name.

The ``cloud.cfg`` file is a special file used to configure the main cloud
configuration in the format ``KEY=value``.

:Cloud Parameters:

    :CLOUD_URL: API endpoint URL for Keystone.
        (default: "")
    :CLOUD_IGNORE_SSL: Ignore unverified SSL certificates. (default: false)
    :CLOUD_ZONE: OpenStack region to use. (default: "")

        (default: "os-cloud")
    :INSTANCE_CAP: Total number of instances the cloud will allow spin up.
        (default: null)
    :SANDBOX_CAP: Total number of instances the clodu will allow to
        spin up. This applies to "sandbox" systems and overrides the
        INSTANCE_CAP setting. (default: null)

:Template Parameters:

    .. note::

       In the case of template definitions of a parameter below is not passed
       the one defined in default clouds will be inherited.

    :IMAGE_NAME: The image name to use for this template.

        (default: jenkins-init-script)
    :INSTANCE_CAP: Total number of instances of this type that can be launched
        at one time. When defined in clouds.cfg it defines the total for the
        entire cloud. (default: null)
    :SANDBOX_CAP: Total number of instances of this type that can be launched
        at one time. When defined in clouds.cfg it defines the total for the
        entire cloud. This applies to "sandbox" systems and overrides the
        INSTANCE_CAP setting. (default: null)
    :FLOATING_IP_POOL: Floating ip pool to use. (default: "")
    :SECURITY_GROUPS: Security group to use. (default: "default")
    :AVAILABILITY_ZONE: OpenStack availability zone to use. (default: "")

        provisioned and connected. (default: 600000)
    :KEY_PAIR_NAME: SSH Public Key Pair to use for authentication.
        (default: jenkins)
    :NUM_EXECUTORS: Number of executors to enable for the instance.
        (default: 1)
    :JVM_OPTIONS: JVM Options to pass to Java. (default: "")
    :FS_ROOT: File system root for the workspace. (default: "/w")
    :RETENTION_TIME: Number of minutes to wait for an idle slave to be used

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Cloud Configuration:

    The directory ``groovy-inserts`` contains the groovy script output that is
    used to push to Jenkins. In the event of a job failure this file can be
    inspected.
