Maven Merge
-----------

Merge job which runs `mvn clean deploy` to build a project.

This job pushes files to Nexus using cURL instead of allowing the Maven deploy
goal to push the upload. This is to get around the issue that Maven deploy does
not properly support uploading files at the end of the build and instead pushes
as it goes. There exists a `-Ddeploy-at-end` feature however it does not work
with extensions.

This job uses the following strategy to deploy jobs to Nexus:

1. `wget -r` to fetch maven-metadata.xml from Nexus
2. `mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository` to prepare files for upload
3. Removes untouched maven-metadata.xml files before upload
4. Use lftools (cURL) upload script to push artifacts to Nexus

:Template Names:

    - {project-name}-maven-merge-{stream}
    - gerrit-maven-merge
    - github-maven-merge

:Comment Trigger: remerge

    :mvn-snapshot-id: Maven Server ID from settings.xml to pull credentials from.
        (Note: This setting should be configured in defaults.yaml.)
    :nexus-snapshot-repo: The repository id of the Nexus snapshot repo to deploy to.

    :branch: Git branch to fetch for the build. (default: master)
    :build-days-to-keep: Days to keep build logs in Jenkins. (default: 7)
    :build-timeout: Timeout in minutes before aborting build. (default: 60)
    :cron: Cron schedule when to trigger the job. This parameter also
        supports multiline input via YAML pipe | character in cases where
        one may want to provide more than 1 cron timer. (default: 'H H * * 0'
        to run weekly)
