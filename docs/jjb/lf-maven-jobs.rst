Maven Merge
-----------

Merge job which runs `mvn clean deploy` to build a project.

This job pushes files to Nexus using cURL instead of allowing the Maven deploy
goal to push the upload. This is to get around the issue that Maven deploy does
not properly support uploading files at the end of the build and instead pushes
as it goes. There exists a `-Ddeploy-at-end` feature however it does not work
with extensions.

This job uses the following strategy to deploy jobs to Nexus:

1. `wget -r` to fetch maven-metadata.xml from Nexus
2. `mvn deploy -DaltDeploymentRepository` to prepare files for upload
3. Removes untouched maven-metadata.xml files before upload
4. Use lftools (cURL) upload script to push artifacts to Nexus

:Template Names:

    - {project-name}-maven-merge-{stream}
    - gerrit-maven-merge
    - github-maven-merge

:Comment Trigger: remerge

:Required parameters:

    :build-node: The node to run build on.
    :jenkins-ssh-credential: Credential to use for SSH. (Generally should
        be configured in defaults.yaml)
    :mvn-settings: The name of settings file containing credentials for the project.
    :mvn-snapshot-id: Maven Server ID from settings.xml to pull credentials from.
        (Note: This setting should be configured in defaults.yaml.)
    :nexus-snapshot-repo: The repository id of the Nexus snapshot repo to deploy to.

:Optional parameters:

    :branch: Git branch to fetch for the build. (default: master)
    :build-days-to-keep: Days to keep build logs in Jenkins. (default: 7)
    :build-timeout: Timeout in minutes before aborting build. (default: 60)
    :cron: Cron schedule when to trigger the job. This parameter also
        supports multiline input via YAML pipe | character in cases where
        one may want to provide more than 1 cron timer. (default: 'H H * * 0'
        to run weekly)
    :git-url: URL clone project from. (default: $GIT_URL/$PROJECT)
    :java-version: Version of Java to use for the build. (default: openjdk8)
    :mvn-global-settings: The name of the Maven global settings to use for
        Maven configuration. (default: global-settings)

Maven Merge for Docker
----------------------

Produces a snapshot docker image in a Nexus registry. Appropriate for
Java projects that do not need to deploy any POM or JAR files.

Similar to Maven Merge as described above but logs in to Docker
registries first and skips the lf-maven-deploy builder. The project
POM file should invoke a plugin to build and push a Docker image. The
base image should be pulled from the registry in the environment
variable CONTAINER_PULL_REGISTRY. The new image should be pushed to the
registry in the environment variable CONTAINER_PUSH_REGISTRY.

:Template Names:

    - {project-name}-maven-docker-merge-{stream}
    - gerrit-maven-docker-merge
    - github-maven-docker-merge

    :container-snapshot-registry: Docker registry target for the deploy action.

All other required and optional parameters are identical to the Maven Merge job
described above.

The staging repo name is in the format PROJECT-NUMBER for example "aaa-1234",
"autorelease-2000", "odlparent-1201", etc...

This job runs a Maven build and deploys to $WORKSPACE/m2repo directory. This
directory is then used later to deploy to Nexus.

:Template Names:

    - {project-name}-maven-stage-{stream}
    - gerrit-maven-stage
    - github-maven-stage

:Comment Trigger: "stage-release" or "stage-maven-release"

    :mvn-central: Set to 'true' to also stage to OSSRH. This is for projects
        that want to release to Maven Central. If set the parameter
        ``ossrh-profile-id`` also needs to be set. (default: false)
