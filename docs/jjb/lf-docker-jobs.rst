Below is a list of Docker job groups:

   :language: yaml


Macros
======

lf-docker-get-container-tag
---------------------------

Chooses a tag to label the container image based on the
'container-tag-method' parameter using the global-jjb script
docker-get-container-tag.sh. Use one of the following methods:

If ``container-tag-method: latest``, uses the literal string ``latest``.

If ``container-tag-method: stream``, uses the value of the variable ``stream``.

If ``container-tag-method: git-describe``, reads the tag from the
``git describe`` command on the repository, which requires that the repository
has a git tag. For example, if the most recent tag is 'v0.48.1', this
method yields a string like 'v0.48.1' or 'v0.48.1-25-gaee2dcb'.

If ``container-tag-method: yaml-file``, reads the tag from the YAML file
``container-tag.yaml`` in the docker-root directory using the top-level entry
'tag'. Alternately specify the directory with the YAML file in parameter
'container-tag-yaml-dir'. An example file appears next.

Example container-tag.yaml file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   tag: 1.0.0


Optionally, teams can supply their own script to choose the docker
tag. Pass the shell script path in optional configuration parameter
'docker-get-container-tag-script' which by default is the path to
file docker-get-container-tag.sh. The script must create the file
'env_docker_inject.txt' in the workspace with a line that assigns a
value to shell variable DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG, as shown next.

Example env_docker_inject.txt file:

.. code-block:: shell

    DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=1.0.0


lf-docker-build
---------------

Calls docker build to build the container.

lf-docker-push
--------------

Calls docker-push.sh script to push docker images.
