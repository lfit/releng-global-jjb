Self Serve Release Jobs
#######################

Self serve release jobs allow a project to create a releases directory and then place a release file in it.
Jenkins will pick this up and then promote the artifact from the staging log directory (log_dir) and tag the release
with the defined version. maven_central_url is optional

.. note::

   Example of a project's release file:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat releases/1.0.0.yaml
   ---
   distribution_type: 'maven'
   version: '1.0.0'
   project: 'example-test-release'
   log_dir: 'example-test-release-maven-stage-master/17/'
   maven_central_url: 'oss.sonatype.org'

.. note::

   Example of a terse Jenkins job to call global-jjb macro:

.. code-block:: none

   - project:
       name: '{project-name}-gerrit-release-jobs'
       project: 'example-test-release'
       build-node: centos7-builder-2c-1g
       project-name: example-test-release
       jobs:
         - '{project-name}-gerrit-release-jobs'

.. note::

   Example of a verbose Jenkins job to call global-jjb macro:

.. code-block:: none

   - project:
       name: '{project-name}-releases-verify'
       project: 'example-test-release'
       build-node: centos7-builder-2c-1g
       project-name: example-test-release
       jobs:
         - 'gerrit-releases-verify'

.. code-block:: none

   - project:
       name: '{project-name}-releases-merge'
       project: 'example-test-release'
       build-node: centos7-builder-2c-1g
       project-name: example-test-release
       jobs:
         - 'gerrit-releases-merge'

.. note::

   Release Engineers Please follow the setup guide before adding the job definition:

Setup for LFID Nexus Jenkins and Gerrit:
========================================

LFID
====

Create an ``lfid`` and an ``ssh-key``

``RELEASE_USERNAME``
``RELEASE_EMAIL``

ssh-key example:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "collab-it+odl-release@linuxfoundation.org"  -f /tmp/odl-release


`Create an LFID <https://identity.linuxfoundation.org>`_

Nexus
=====

Create a Nexus account called ``'jenkins-release'`` with promote privileges.

.. image:: ../_static/nexus-promote-privs.png

Gerrit
======

Log into your Gerrit with ``RELEASE_USERNAME``, upload the ``ssh-key`` you created earlier.
Log out of Gerrit and log in again with your normal account for the next steps.

In Gerrit create a new group called ``self-serve-release`` and give it direct push rights via ``All-Projects``
``push - refs/heads/*``

1. Add a push reference
2. Set the ref as refs/heads/*
3. Make sure "force push" is not checked

Add ``RELEASE_USERNAME`` to group ``self-serve-release`` and group ``Non-Interactive Users``

Give group ``self-serve-release`` Forge Committer rights on ``refs/tags/*``
Give group ``self-serve-release`` Allow on ``Create Signed Tag``
Give group ``self-serve-release`` Allow on ``Create Annotated Tag``

Jenkins
=======

Add a global credential to Jenkins called ``jenkins-release`` and set the ID: ``'jenkins-release'``
as its value insert the ``ssh-key`` that you uploaded to Gerrit.

Add Global vars in Jenkins:
Jenkins configre -> Global properties -> Environment variables

``RELEASE_USERNAME = $RELEASE_USERNAME``
``RELEASE_EMAIL = $RELEASE_EMAIL``

Jenkins configre -> Managed Files -> Custom File

id: signing-pubkey
Name: SIGNING_PUBKEY (optional)
Comment: SIGNING_PUBKEY (optional)

Content: (ask andy)
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----


Add or edit the managed file in Jenkins called ``lftoolsini``, appending a nexus section:
Jenkins Settings -> Managed files -> Add (or edit) -> Custom file

.. code-block:: none

   [nexus]
   username=jenkins-release
   password=redacted

Ci-management
=============

upgrade you projects global-jjb if needed
add this to your global defaults file (eg: jjb/defaults.yaml)

.. code-block:: bash

   jenkins-ssh-release-credential: 'jenkins-release'

Macros
======

lf-release
----------

Release verify and merge jobs are the same except for their scm, trigger, and
builders definition. This anchor is the common template.

Job Templates
=============

Release Merge

Runs:

- sigul-install
- sigul-configuration
- checkout ref from taglist.log
- applies the $PROJECT.bundle
- signs, tags and pushes

Release Verify
------------------

Release verify job checks the schema and ensures that the staging-repo.txt.gz
