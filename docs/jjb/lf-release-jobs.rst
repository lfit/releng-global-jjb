Self-Serve Release Jobs
=======================

Self-serve release jobs allow project committers to direct Jenkins to
promote a jar file, container image or Python package from a staging
area to a release area.

To use the self-release process, create a releases/ or .releases/
directory at the root of the project repository, add one release yaml
file to it, and submit a change set with that release yaml file.  The
required contents of the release yaml file are different for each type
of release, see the schemas and examples shown below.  The version in
the release yaml file must be a valid Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
string, matching either the pattern "v#.#.#" or "#.#.#" where "#" is
one or more digits.  Upon merge of the change, Jenkins will sign the
reference extrapolated by log_dir and promote the artifact.

.. note::

   The release file regex is: (releases\/.*\.yaml|\.releases\/.*\.yaml).
   In words, the directory name can be ".releases" or "releases"; the file
   name can be anything with suffix ".yaml".

The build node for all release jobs must be CentOS, which supports the
sigul client for accessing a signing server. The build node for
container release jobs must have Docker installed.

A Jenkins admin user can also trigger a release job via the "Build
with parameters" action, removing the need to create and merge a
release yaml file.  The user must enter parameters in the same way as
a release yaml file, except for the special USE_RELEASE_FILE and
DRY_RUN check boxes. The user must uncheck the USE_RELEASE_FILE check
box if the job should run without a release file, instead passing the
required information as build parameters. The user can check the
DRY_RUN check box to test the job while skipping upload of files to
the release repository.

For example, the parameters for a Maven release are as follows::

    GERRIT_BRANCH = master
    VERSION = 1.0.0
    LOG_DIR = example-project-maven-stage-master/17/
    DISTRIBUTION_TYPE = maven
    USE_RELEASE_FILE = false
    DRY_RUN = false

Setup for LFID, Nexus, Jenkins and Gerrit
-----------------------------------------

This section is for the Linux Foundation release engineering team.

LFID
~~~~

Create an ``lfid`` and an ``ssh-key``

``YOUR_RELEASE_USERNAME`` for example: onap-release

``YOUR_RELEASE_EMAIL`` for example: collab-it+onap-release@linuxfoundation.org

ssh-key example:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "collab-it+odl-release@linuxfoundation.org"  -f /tmp/odl-release


`Create an LFID with the above values <https://identity.linuxfoundation.org>`_


Nexus
~~~~~

Create a Nexus account called ``'jenkins-release'`` with promote privileges.

.. image:: ../_static/nexus-promote-privs.png

Gerrit
~~~~~~

Log into your Gerrit with ``YOUR_RELEASE_USERNAME``, upload the public
part of the ``ssh-key`` you created earlier. Log out of Gerrit and log
in again with your normal account for the next steps.


In Gerrit create a new group called ``self-serve-release`` and give it
direct push rights via ``All-Projects`` Add ``YOUR_RELEASE_USERNAME``
to group ``self-serve-release`` and group ``Non-Interactive Users``


In All project, grant group self-serve-release the following:

.. code-block:: none

    [access "refs/heads/*"]
      push = group self-serve-release
    [access "refs/tags/*"]
      createTag = group self-serve-release
      createSignedTag = group self-serve-release
      forgeCommitter = group self-serve-release
      push = group self-serve-release


Jenkins
~~~~~~~

Add a global credential to Jenkins called ``jenkins-release`` and set
the ID: ``'jenkins-release'`` as its value insert the private half of
the ``ssh-key`` that you created for your Gerrit user.

Add Global variables in Jenkins:
Jenkins configure -> Global properties -> Environment variables::

    RELEASE_USERNAME = YOUR_RELEASE_USERNAME
    RELEASE_EMAIL = YOUR_RELEASE_EMAIL


.. note::

    Add these variables to your global-vars-$SILO.sh file or they will
    be overwritten.

Jenkins configure -> Managed Files -> Add a New Config -> Custom File

.. code-block:: none

    id: signing-pubkey
    Name: SIGNING_PUBKEY (optional)
    Comment: SIGNING_PUBKEY (optional)

    Content: (Ask Andy for the public signing key)
    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----


Add or edit the managed file in Jenkins called ``lftoolsini``,
appending a nexus section: Jenkins Settings -> Managed files -> Add
(or edit) -> Custom file

.. code-block:: none

   [nexus.example.com]
   username=jenkins-release
   password=<plaintext password>

Ci-management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade your project's global-jjb if needed, then add the following to
your global defaults file (e.g., jjb/defaults.yaml).

.. code-block:: none

   jenkins-ssh-release-credential: jenkins-release
