Releng Release Files
####################

Projects can create a releases directory and then place a release file in it.
Jenkins will pick this up and then promote the artifact from the staging log
directory (log_dir) and tag the release with the defined version.
if a maven_central_url is given artifact will be pushed there as well.

example of a projects release file

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat releases/1.0.0.yaml
    ---
    distribution_type: 'maven'
    version: '1.0.0'
    project: 'zzz-test-release'
    log_dir: 'zzz-test-release-maven-stage-master/17/'
    maven_central_url: 'oss.sonatype.org'

lftools nexus release is used so there must be a lftoolsini section in jenkins
configfiles with a [nexus] section for auth.

Macros
======

lf-releases
----------------------

Release verify and merge jobs are the same except for their scm, trigger, and
builders definition. This anchor is the common template.

Job Templates
=============

Release Merge
-------------

Runs:

- sigul-install
- sigul-configuration
- checkout ref from taglist.log
- applies the $PROJECT.bundle
- signs, tags and pushes

.. code-block:: bash

   lftools nexus release --server $NEXUS_URL $STAGING_REPO
