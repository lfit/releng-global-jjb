Job Templates
=============

ReadTheDocs Merge
-----------------

Merge job which triggers a POST of the docs project to readthedocs.

To use this job first configure the ``Generic API incoming webhook`` in
ReadTheDocs. To do that follow these steps:

#. Browse to https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/PROJECT/integrations/
#. Click on ``Generic API incoming webhook``

   .. note::

      If not available click on ``Add integration`` and add the
      ``Generic API incoming webhook``.

#. Copy the custom webhook URL, this is your ``rtd-build-url``

   For example: https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/webhook/opendaylight/32321/

#. Copy the token, this is your ``rtd-token``
