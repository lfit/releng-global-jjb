Job Templates
=============

ReadTheDocs Merge
-----------------

Merge job which triggers a POST of the docs project to readthedocs.  There is some setup
required on read the docs to get started with this.  After you have created the
individual read the docs project (lets call it "PROJECT" here), then browse to
https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/PROJECT/integrations/ and click on
"Generic API incoming webhook".  Here you will see a custom url to trigger the job as
well as a token.  Persist the token in the project Jenkins global-settings
file.  You will need to put it in a username/password credentials type to make
it available in the global-settings file.  set ```rtd-build-url to the
custom build url as defined in read the docs.  Also set the rtd-server-id
to the id you specified in the global-settings file, this will enable the script to parse
the token out. Set ```rtd-project``` to your read the docs project name.
