      "message": "This script is not called in with ci-management repos... this job clones the tech team repo. for example, if the trigger is any files in ccsdk/parent, we will need the files from ci-management (the schema) to be able to validate it. \n\nPlease look into how the verify info job works. is the exact same case:\nhttps://github.com/lfit/releng-global-jjb/blob/master/jjb/lf-ci-jobs.yaml#L1170\nThe info verify job is added in the tech team repos which means the workspace clones the tech team code not ci-management. \nThe verify job processes a similar build step which has to compare the schema file we have stored in global-jjb. Hence, the clone is needed:\nhttps://github.com/lfit/releng-global-jjb/blob/master/shell/info-file-validate.sh#L20",
