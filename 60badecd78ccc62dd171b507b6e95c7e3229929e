      "message": "The question I had was, why does this file exist? It is a one-liner that does nothing useful (except call the \u0027real package-listing.sh).\n\nThe chmod is pretty useless, the script it is calling is in a repo, so we control the permissions.\n\nIt is, of course easy enough to recreate the file. There may be some history behind this files existence, which may explain how we got here.",
