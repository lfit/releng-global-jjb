      "message": "My only real problem with this change is that I don\u0027t love the variable name being used. I see two issues with it: I\u0027d prefer \"scan\" rather than \"use\" in order to better document what the variable is affecting, and I think \"short-lived\" is wordier than necessary. It could be replaced by \"feature\" or \"dev\". If I was coming across this while perusing code, I think I\u0027d understand what it was for much more intuitively if it was named \"scan-dev-branch\" rather than \"use-short-lived-branch\".\n\nThis is just a suggestion, but I think it would clarify the code.",
