      "message": "I would bet that virtualenv and python -m env are equivalent (they call same python function/library).\n\nafter sourcing \u0027activate\u0027, \u0027pip\u0027 and \u0027python\u0027 both come from /tmp/v/venv/bin so\npip install niet\npip install lftools\npip install lftools[nexus]\npip install jsonschema\n\nis all that is needed.\n\nIt is really what I hate about sourcing \u0027activate\u0027 rather than doing an explicit addition to the PATH or executing using full path: /tmp/v/venv/bin/pip or /tmp/v/venv/bin/lftools. Sourcing \u0027activate\u0027 just obfuscates what is really happening and it not meant to be used from a batch script.\n\nThe explicit paths allows allow you to safely call an executable based on python 3 and another based on python 2 from the same script. The PATH change ties the entire script to one python. You actually do that every day, it is way all python executables installed in /bin work. \n\nYes, what is here \u0027will work\u0027. But when I review it, I wonder what the authors intentions are",
