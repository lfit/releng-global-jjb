# Global JJB

Global-JJB is a library project containing reusable Jenkins Job Builder
templates. Mainly used by LFCI to deploy management Jenkins jobs to an LF
managed Jenkins instance, there are other jobs defined for which may be helpful
to projects whom use the same build technology. The intention is to save time
for projects from having to define their own job templates.
