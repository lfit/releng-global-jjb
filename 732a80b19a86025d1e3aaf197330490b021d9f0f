      "message": "@chris, when pushing packages up to packagecloud via the merge job that you guys use, there isn\u0027t an output of $VERSION anywhere other than in the package name. Is there a case when the version of the package is not the version of the release? Also if that is not the case, it seems a bit redundant to grep the package name and the version, if package name will always include the version of the release as well.",

      "message": "I thought that package name has just words (no version) and therefore I added a grep for version to be confident the job is promoting a package that was also built by Jenkins.  In the RST, the example looks suspect to me:\n\n    package_name: tree-1.6.0\n\nI believe the package_name is just \"tree\" and the version is \"1.6.0\".  So my assumption was that the package name would remain constant, and the version would vary over time.\n \nDoes this answer your question?",
