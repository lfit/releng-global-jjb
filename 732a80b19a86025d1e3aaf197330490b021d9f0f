      "message": "@chris, when pushing packages up to packagecloud via the merge job that you guys use, there isn\u0027t an output of $VERSION anywhere other than in the package name. Is there a case when the version of the package is not the version of the release? Also if that is not the case, it seems a bit redundant to grep the package name and the version, if package name will always include the version of the release as well.",
