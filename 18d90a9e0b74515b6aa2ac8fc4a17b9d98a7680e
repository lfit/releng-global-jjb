      "message": "Removing a flag is not the right fix for Ubuntu or CentOS. I think this busted the CI cron/builder/ci-man jobs, across projects. \n\nhttps://jenkins.onap.org/view/ci-management/job/ci-management-openstack-cron/26935/\n\npython3.8 is available on this node. However it returns the following error .... since python3.8-venv is missing, the issue is seen. Note: Going thru the def of `lf-activate-env` the `‚Äìpython` arg is required for both platforms.\n\nThe sol to this is to install the python3.8-venv, either through the python-install.sh (quick fix in common-packer) or through lfit,python-install ansible role. \n\nHope this helps! üôè",
