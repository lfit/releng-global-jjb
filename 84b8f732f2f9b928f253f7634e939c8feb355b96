      "message": "I disagree: this really is a \"Stopgap\" in that it disables cost collection, i.e. we are losing info we want to collect in order to make jobs more reliable.\n\nIn particular, while this fixes IT-28614, it causes a regression which could be characterized as \"GLOBALJJB-XYZ: stack costs are always 0\" (or a GH equivalent).\n\nExplanation of the stop-gap being proposed should link to that issue and explain the problem in lftools: at the end of the day, if we arm timers around openstack invocations, we report accurate results if they are available, say, in under a minute.",

      "message": "As the commit message suggests ...\n\"This change disables the problematic stack cost retrieval and sets the cost to 0 while the underlying lftools timeout issue is being addressed upstream.\" \n\nThe reason this is being disabled is that the cost data has not been generated or used for more than a year now. The issue has been discussed internally with Andrew and it\u0027s was decided cost changes need to be disabled or removed.",
