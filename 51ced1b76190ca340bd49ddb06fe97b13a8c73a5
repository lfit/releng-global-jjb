      "message": "Vratko: Trying to understand the bigger pictire here and how does this achives testing multiple versions JJB with the global-jjb submodule? \n\nci-man JJB-verify already takes a version number as input param, however at times when the code itself needs to be updated and not backward compatible (for ex: with JJB 6x and 5x), you\u0027ll need a complete diff change set to test with the outdated version. The verify job should checkout the latest version of the submodule from the CR and not from the HEAD of the $branch.\n\nNote: job-config xml output isn\u0027t changed with the upgrade!  \n\nTherefore it might be better to ensure parity with JJB output{s} generated by the older version (5x) and newer version (6x) to ensure there aren\u0027t and diffirences.",
