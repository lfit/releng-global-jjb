      "message": "Using pushd/popd vrs cd is matter a style. I personally don\u0027t like pushd/popd in scripts because changing dirs in script is best kept to a minimum, and never \u0027cd\u0027 in a function. When you do need to change dirs, keep it simple, cd foo \u0026 cd - or (cd foo ; cmd). You can use pushd/popd but you should never take advantage of it\u0027s full functionality in a script. I also don\u0027t like the fact that pushd/popd pollute the log. Given all that, when I review scripts that contain pushd/popd, I might comment on it, but as long as they keep it simple, I realize it is a style issue.\n\nWhen I talk to people about why they use pushd/popd it is usually because they don\u0027t know about \u0027cd -\u0027 or (cd foo ; cmd) and they just copied the pushd/popd from another script.",
