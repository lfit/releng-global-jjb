      "message": "perhaps, possibly, instead of writing this expression twice (lines 35 and 36), write it once and use it twice?\n\nAre you sure you\u0027re getting a single space?  I sorta think you\u0027re getting the empty string, based on these little experiments:\n\n    % echo \"\u003e${foo:-}\u003c\"\n    \u003e\u003c\n\n    % cmd\u003d${undefined:-} \n    % echo \"the command is \u003e$cmd\u003c\"\n    the command is \u003e\u003c\n\n\nAnyhow I agree if you put double-quotes around an expression that evaluates to the empty string and feed that to a shell command, that command-line argument will be the empty string, and the command will choke on it.\n\nJust trying to keep up here.",
