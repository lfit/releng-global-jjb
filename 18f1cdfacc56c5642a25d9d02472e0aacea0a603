      "message": "I tested this on the EdgeX sandbox. EdgeX has one builder that uses a v2 type that was not recreated in v3, so it still has a volume_size set. Tests showed that this properly set the type and size when volume_size is set, and uses the correct settings when it is missing, making a yaml file that was successfully loaded by JCasC and properly recreated the builders in the way config-merge jjb jobs would.",
