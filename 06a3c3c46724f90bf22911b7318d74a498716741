My thought that S3_BUCKET was what we\u0027re using is, while accurate, incorrect in this particular case.\n\nCDN_URL is what you\u0027re actually using so you should be checking for that and commenting if it\u0027s missing not S3_BUCKET.\n\nSo, the check you had in Patch 7 was correct, but the error text was wrong.",
