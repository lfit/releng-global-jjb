I\u0027ve thought about this a little bit more.\n\nSo, here is the proposal:\n\nValidate that the version string is _either_ \"v${SEMVER}\" _or_ \"${SEMVER}\" fail all other types. That way projects can tag as either SemVer (as ONAP is) or \"v${SEMVER}\" like all of our other projects are (I believe). I still want to put a hard fail on non-semver versions.\n\nSo, the validation should happen before this step and if it passes then everything else in here is fine.",
