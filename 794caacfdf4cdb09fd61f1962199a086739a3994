So we cannot double quote here as it would create a 1 item array rather than a multi-item array.\n\nAlthough the patch I04fc3a083c420f71938b99f942b682093822ddda does away with the need to create this array in the first place. I think we should merge that over there but let\u0027s fix this one up first.",
