What specifically was problematic with prior versions that is fixed in 1.4.3?\n\nI did some digging and found these 3 items from the 1.4.3 release notes. Are these related to the issues being referred to?\n\nbuilder/docker: Check container os, not host os, when creating container dir default [GH-7939]\nbuilder/docker: Fix bug where PACKER_TMP_DIR was created with root perms on linux [GH-7905]\nbuilder/docker: Fix file download hang caused by blocking ReadAll call [GH-7814]\n\nWould be good to have this detail in the reno release notes too.",
