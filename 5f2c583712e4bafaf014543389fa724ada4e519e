      "message": "@Chris: If you look at many of the older scripts in the LF/releng repos, we\u0027ve always tried to optimize the performance. YES, if you are trying to save a few CPU cycles you are still saving some resource and costs in the long term, with writing better code. Note: these scripts in global-jjb are actually pulled many upstream projects.\n\nHow is using a simple regex \"zgrep -E \"Pushing.*$PACKAGE_NAME-$VERSION.*success\\!\" is any more complicated to read as compared to extra greps and pipes?",
