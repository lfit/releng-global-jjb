      "message": "Personally my rule of thumb is if an end user doesn\u0027t need to care, then set a reasonable default. Requiring all projects to copy paste configuration that the majority of the time they probably just want the defaults seems excessive.\n\nFor example if the 3 boolean fields above will typically be false then setting it in the view-template will allow one less configuration someone setting this up needs to worry about.\n\nSame with view-regex and view-description. I can\u0027t imagine a user of the common-view will care about setting this 99% of the time.\n\nI\u0027m not going to -1 for this but IMO less is more.",
