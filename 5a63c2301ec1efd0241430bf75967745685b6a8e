A release note should be provided that details the change in config file naming for this parameter.\n\nAlso using all lowercase goes against the current standard of keys being all upper case in config files.\n\nPersonally I\u0027d probably refrain from renaming variables that are in production as this appears to be mostly a cosmetic change.",

Here\u0027s what I\u0027ll do:\n\nSince 2.46.1 and lower can\u0027t use these extra params, the first block is thrown out (after I commit the fix, should be 2.47).\n\nI\u0027ll keep the original param for everything 2.46.1 and below, and as part as the support for 2.47+ we\u0027ll move to the new param (and note the change in the release docs of course).\n\nSince everyone using 2.47+ will have to touch their configs in order for this to work, it\u0027s a trivial issue at that point.",
