    Introduce Go Snyk CLI scanner jobs. These jobs can be triggered to download the
    latest version of Snyk's CLI scanner and trigger a scan for Go based repos. These
    jobs produce a report which is published into Snyk's dashboard. These reports are
    fetched and reflected back into the LFX Security tool.
