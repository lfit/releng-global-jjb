  Jenkins Job Builder 6.0.0 is released and breaks backward compatibility
  with 5.1.0.

  The breaking changes with previous 5.1.0 release:

    - Jobs are now expanded the same way as job templates.
    - Macros without parameters are now expanded the same way as macros with
      parameters.
    - Tags !include-raw: and !include-raw-escape: should now be used the same
      way in jobs and macros without parameters as they are used in job
      templates and macros with parameters.
issues:
  - |
    This breaks backward compatibility with older version of JJB
    therefore care must be taken during upgrade on the ci-man repositories.
upgrade:
  - |
    Upgrade Jenkins-job-builder to 6.0.0 as the default version.
