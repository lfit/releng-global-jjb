    Add lf-sonar-common job-template to lf-ci-jobs.yaml and add lf-infra-sonar
    to macros.yaml. The purpose of a new job template is to adopt using jenkins
    sonar plug-in along with the sonar-project.properties file versus pom.xml.
    Lastly the new job template will ensure that anything using lf-infra-tox-sonar
    is unaffected.
