    A new version of setuptools==72.2.0 is not compatible with
    the python 3.12.4 and JJB 6.3.0 which results in errors.
    This requires adding pkg_resources.extern to the
    hidden imports for setuptools >= 70.0.

    ERROR:stevedore.extension:Could not load 'delete': No module
    named 'pkg_resources.extern'
