fixes:
  - |
    Allow DOCKER_ARGS to be empty in docker-build.sh. This is not a
    required parameter, it can be empty.

    Remove container reference in docker-get-git-describe.sh. The
    CONTAINER_PUSH_REGISTRY already gets added in the docker-push script.
    No need to add it again.

    Rename image_name to image_build_tag in docker-get-yaml-tag to match
    docker-get-git-describe. Add missing "DOCKER_NAME" in the DOCKER_IMAGE.

    docker-get-git-describe.sh and docker-get-yaml-tag.sh should only export
    the tag variable. Let docker-build.sh process DOCKER_NAME
