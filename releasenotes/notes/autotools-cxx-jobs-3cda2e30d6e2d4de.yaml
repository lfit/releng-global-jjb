    Add new templates to build CXX projects with GNU autotools.
    These support the "configure && make && make install"
    pattern used by many open-source projects. Supports
    generation of the configure script for projects that do
    not store generated files in version control. Includes
    gerrit and github versions of autotools-packagecloud-stage,
    autotools-sonarqube and autotools-verify.
