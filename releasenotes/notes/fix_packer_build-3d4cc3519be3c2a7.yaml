    The packer merge job has a boolean option that sets an UPDATE_CLOUD_IMAGE
    variable. This variable was always evaluating to true which caused issues
    with builds always executing the section of the build. This causes problems
    for builds that do not produce information that is expected by the section
    of code. In specific AWS / EC2 builds fail as the build engine outputs
    different name data than expected. The variable is now properly evaluated.
