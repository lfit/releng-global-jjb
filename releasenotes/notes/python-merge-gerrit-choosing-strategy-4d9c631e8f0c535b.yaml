    Use git choosing strategy default in tox and pypi merge jobs for
    gerrit.  This makes those jobs consistent with maven and other
    merge jobs for gerrit that always build from tip of the target
    branch to create artifacts from the latest & greatest code.
    Building from tip (not from Gerrit commit/merge point) avoids
    confusion about content when changes are merged out of order.
    For example, a fix is submitted and merged, but the merge job
    fails. In the mean time, a different change that happened
    earlier in commit history gets merged (or the merge job is
    retriggered), causing a new artifact to be pushed.  But that
    artifact does not have the expected fix.

    Add comments to release merge jobs why their choosing strategy
    is not default.

    Document the git commit choosing strategy for the release merge jobs.
