    Use git choosing strategy default in tox and pypi merge jobs.
    This makes those jobs consistent with maven and other merge
    jobs that always build from tip of the target branch to
    create artifacts from the latest & greatest code.  Building
    from tip (not from Gerrit commit/merge point) avoids confusion
    about content when changes are merged out of order.  For
    example, a fix is submitted and merged, but the merge job
    fails. In the mean time, a different change that happened
    earlier in commit history gets merged (or the merge job is
    retriggered), causing a new artifact to be pushed.  But that
    artifact does not have the expected fix.

    Update the github release jobs to match the gerrit jobs.

    Add comments to release merge jobs why their choosing strategy
    is not default.

    Document the git commit choosing strategy for the release merge jobs.
