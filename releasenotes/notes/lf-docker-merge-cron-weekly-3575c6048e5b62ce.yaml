    Add @weekly cron default value to docker_merge_common anchor, no longer
    empty. The merge job for docker images is like the stage job for java
    artifacts, every docker image is a release candidate.  Run the merge job
    regularly to check dependencies like base images and to push updated
    images to the Nexus3 staging registry.
