    Fix the jjb-deploy job to accept a JJB_VERSION parameter in the parameters
    field so that projects can select which version of JJB they want for the job.

    The change that ended up breaking jjb-deploy was caused by this Gerrit
    patch here:

    https://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/infra/c/releng/global-jjb/+/62788

    The bug was introduced in the lf-env.sh when the lf-pip-install macro was
    removed. Prior to the removal the jjb-deploy job was installing the latest
    and greatest JJB version. However now jjb-deploy is now installing the
    fallback version of JJB_VERSION from the lf-env.sh script which is 2.8.0.
