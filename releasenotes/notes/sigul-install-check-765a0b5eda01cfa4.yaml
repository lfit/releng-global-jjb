    Update sigul-install.sh to check for sigul. If sigul is already installed,
    we can skip the installation. This is important due to kojipkgs being
    unreliable. We now have the sigul binary baked into the base image creation,
    so newer images should already have sigul on board. If they do and we still
    try to do this manual installation, we could still run into connection
    issues with kojipkgs.
