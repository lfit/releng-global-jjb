    Fix the race condition by checking the created_at timestamp and clean up
    ports that were created atleast 30 minutes before.

    There a race condition in the openstack-cron job that causes the script to
    delete ports in DOWN state and are still in use by the VM, causing the
    ODL CSIT jobs to fail.
