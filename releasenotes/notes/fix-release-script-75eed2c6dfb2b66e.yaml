    Updates the command to retrieve the correct digest sha256 of a docker image
    after it has been pushed to a container registry in the release script.
    Previously, the script was incorrectly attempting to get the sha256 from
    the local docker images, which does not provide the correct digest needed
    for signing the image with cosign. The fix uses `docker inspect` to get
    the digest from the pushed image in the registry.
