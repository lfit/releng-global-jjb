fixes:
  - |
    Rename "RELEASE_FILE" parameter to "USE_RELEASE_FILE" in release-jobs.
    This will match the actual varaible default value better and will not
    collide with the local "release_file" in the script.
  - |
    Fix "USE_RELEASE_FILE" if statement. We are now using a bool instead of
    a string. Changing the if statements to evaluate bools.
