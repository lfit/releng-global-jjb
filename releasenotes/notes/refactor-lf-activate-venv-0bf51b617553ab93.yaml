    Add support for a new option to set venv file.

    lf-activate-venv --venv-file /tmp/.robot_venv robotframework

    Modify lf-activate-venv() to allow creation of a venv file and re-use the
    venv to improve job performance. When a dependency is already installed, pip
    skips the package therefore reduces the time it takes to create
    venv in every script.

    Precedence for venv file.
      a. Re-use an existing venv file if one exists.
           1. Use venv file path from --venv-file
           2. Use default venv file path "/tmp/.os_lf_venv"
      b. Create new venv when 1. and 2. is absent

    Note: The default file "/tmp/.os_lf_venv" is created by a pre-build
    script (../shell/python-tools-install.sh).

    In the situation where a fresh venv is required remove "/tmp/.os_lf_venv"
    before calling lf-activate-venv().

    Update all the required scripts that call lf-activate-venv().
fixes:

    Clean up conditions introduce in the shell scripts, while these checks
    are performed within lf-activate-venv().
