    Change parameter names used to specify container tag method,
    with a new default to use the fixed string 'latest' as a tag.
    Merge two shell scripts into one instead of using Jenkins
    conditional steps.
    Extend to accept a custom directory for the container-tag.yaml
    if the yaml-file method is used to set the docker tag information;
    this is an optional variable which is set to empty by default,
    and falls back to DOCKER_ROOT.
