    Verify build nodes named in YAML files against config files.
    Extend lf-jjb-verify anchor with script jjb-verify-build-nodes.sh.
    The script checks build-node labels in YAML files within the jjb
    subdirectory against labels defined by config files in the jenkins
    cloud configuration directory.  Use a conditional build step
    guarded by existence of jenkins-config/clouds/openstack so the
    verify step only runs on projects, not on global-jjb.
