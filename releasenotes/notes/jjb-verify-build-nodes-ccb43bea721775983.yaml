    Verify build nodes named in YAML files against config files.
    Extend lf-jjb-verify anchor to call script jjb-verify-build-nodes.sh.
    Script checks build-node labels in YAML files within the jjb
    subdirectory against labels defined by config files in the jenkins
    configuration directory for minions.  Use a conditional build step
    guarded by existence of jenkins-config/clouds/openstack so the verify
    step runs on projects, not on global-jjb.
