    Verify build nodes named in YAML files against config files.
    Extend lf-jjb-verify anchor with boolean configuration variable
    check-build-node-labels that guards a conditional build step.
    If true, run script jjb-verify-build-nodes.sh to check build-node
    labels in YAML files within the jjb subdirectory against labels
    defined by config files in the jenkins cloud configuration
    directory.  Disabled by default.  Projects should enable and
    configure the job; e.g., for external build node labels.
