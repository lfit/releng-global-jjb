    Add missing config property "stream: master" to lf_cmake_sonar macro
    in lf-c-cpp-jobs.yaml to match existing "branch: master" property.
    This makes the template consistent with other Sonar templates.

    Remove double-quote chars that were added recently around $make_opts
    from the invocation of the build wrapper in cmake-sonar.sh.  This
    makes the invocation consistent with the invocation of cmake in the
    same file.

    Update documentation to reflect correct property names and defaults.
