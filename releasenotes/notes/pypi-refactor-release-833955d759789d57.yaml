    Refactor PyPI release-verify and release-merge templates to download
    distribution files from a PyPI staging index and upload the files to a
    PyPI release index.  Remove all the builders that were previously used.
    This makes the PyPI release merge templates highly similar to the
    release-job merge templates.  Revise documentation appropriately.
