    Refactor PyPI release-verify and release-merge templates to download
    distribution files from a PyPI staging index and upload the files to a
    PyPI release index.  Remove all the builders that were previously used.
    This makes the PyPI release merge templates highly similar to the
    release-job merge templates.  Revise documentation appropriately.
    Drop the PyPI job groups because the verify & merge templates do not
    accept the same arguments as release-verify & release-merge templates.
    Move the PyPI release features to the lf-release-jobs.(rst,yaml) files.
