    By default, the lf-venv-create() function only installs/upgrades 'pip' and
    and any packages that need to be tied to a specific version like. Currently
    the only version specific package is: 'jenkins-job-builder==2.8.0'. The
    current version of lf-venv-create() supports being called twice but that
    functionality has NOT yet been thoroughly tested. RELENG-2508 has been
    created to validate & optimize that functionality.
