    By default, the lf-venv-create() function only installs/upgrades 'pip' and
    and base packages that need to be tied to a specific version like. Right now
    that is only "jenkins-job-builder==2.8.0".  The current version of
    lf-venv-create() supports being called twice but that functionality has NOT
    yet been thoroughly tested. RELENG-2508 has been created for that work.
