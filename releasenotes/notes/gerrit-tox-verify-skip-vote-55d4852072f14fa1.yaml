    **gerrit-tox-verify** now has a new set of parameters (bool) to
    control whether Jenkins should skip voting depending on the build
    outcome: ``skip-vote-successful``, ``skip-vote-failed``,
    ``skip-vote-unstable`` and ``skip-vote-notbuilt``. All of them
    default to ``false`` since it is the default used by the Jenkins
    Gerrit Trigger Plugin.
