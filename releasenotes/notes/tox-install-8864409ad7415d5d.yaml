    Pip install pyenv from python2 should force more-itertools to 5.0.0
    In a fresh python2.7 venv "pip install pyenv" correctly pulls down
    more-itertools [required: Any, installed: 5.0.0]
    If for some reason a higher version is already installed this will downgrade
    more-itertools to a py2 compatible version
