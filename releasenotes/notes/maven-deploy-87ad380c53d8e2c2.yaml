    Resolves the lftools_activate failure below.

    .. code-block:: bash

        ---> maven-deploy.sh
        ImportError: cannot import name 'enquote_executable'

    Fix is to replace lftools_activate with lf-activate-venv
    by sourcing lf-env.sh
    lf-activate-venv is a more error resistant way to make sure a pip
    package is installed

deprecates:
  - |
    lftools_activate should no longer be used and will be removed
    in a future release.
