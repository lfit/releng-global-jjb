    Merge bundle after checking detached head.

    Address the problem where the tag is not merged into master
    i.e. the release is not part of the master history.

    Check commit count between the HEAD and origin/${GERRIT_BRANCH}
    before the fetch and merge operation. This is done to ensure the
    git bundle along get pushed on the correct branch to avoid
    repushing the commit the master.
