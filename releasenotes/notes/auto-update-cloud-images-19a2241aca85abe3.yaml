    Add template to update OpenStack cloud images.
  - |
    This job finds and updates OpenStack cloud images on the ci-management
    source repository.
  - |
    The job is triggered in two ways:
  - |
    1. When a packer merge job completes, the new image name created is passed
       down to the job.
    2. Manually trigger the job to update all images.
  - |
    When the job is triggered through an upstream packer merge job, this only
    generates a change request for the new image built.
  - |
    When the job is triggered manually, this job finds the latest images on
    OpenStack cloud and compares them with the images currently used in
    the source ci-management source repository. If the compared images have
    newer time stamps are **all** updated through a change request.
  - |
    This job requires a Jenkins configuration merge and verify job setup and
