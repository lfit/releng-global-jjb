    New templates gerrit-cmake-sonarcloud and github-cmake-sonarcloud
    use the SonarQube Jenkins plug-in to analyze CXX code and publish
    the results.  Modeled after the generic gerrit/github-sonar templates.
    The new templates lift the limitations of the existing templates
    gerrit/github-cmake-sonar which download and install a Sonar scanner,
    and cannot report unit-test code coverage statistics.
