    Workarounds for aging python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04 builders 
    Ubuntu 16.04 calls a python2 version of tox we must upgrade
    it even if we are testing with python3
    ubuntu 16.04 has runs python 3.5 we must pinn the zipp package
    more pinns will be needed as packages drop support for python 3.5
    ideally projects will move away from this distro.
