    "$_" does not expand as expected on Ubuntu

    While using Ubuntu as default builder nodes.
    The .bashrc file does not process '$_' expanding
    the output correctly as provided in previous line.
    Therefore explicitly use the dirname or use /bin/bash.

    This results in an copy error.

    This happens is because by default Ubuntu "/bin/sh"
    points to "/bin/dash" while on CentOS / RedHat points to
    "/bin/bash".
