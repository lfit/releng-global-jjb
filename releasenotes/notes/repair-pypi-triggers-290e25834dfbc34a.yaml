    In the PyPI merge template, add cron parameter to support daily build
    and push to a staging repo, like the maven merge template.
    In PyPI release templates, change name of gerrit and github trigger
    file patterns parameter. This avoids accidental overriding by jobs
    that limit their actions to subdirectories. The release file patterns
    are hardcoded in a shell script. Remove params from RST doc.
    In all PyPI templates, add disabled option and disable-job parameter
    to be consistent with other python templates.
