    Drop jobs gerrit-python-xc-clm and github-python-xc-clm from
    the two python job groups. Those templates were replaced by
    gerrit-tox-nexus-iq-clm and github-tox-nexus-iq-clm. Not adding
    those templates to the job groups because successful use requires
    additional project configuration to report the package requirements.
