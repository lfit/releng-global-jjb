    Fix update cloud image list job to handle newlines correctly and update
    an existing gerrit change request.

    A gerrit change submitted through git-review checks for the an existing
    change-id on Gerrit and either updates the patchset or creates a new one.
    For this to work correctly the change-id should go into the commit footer
    and not in the GERRIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE. The embedded newlines are not
    processed correctly in the script and fails to separate the footer and the
    GERRIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE, instead it creates a new patches everytime rather
    than updating an existing one.

    The change is tested now existing CR's are updated rather than pushing a
    new CR everytime.
