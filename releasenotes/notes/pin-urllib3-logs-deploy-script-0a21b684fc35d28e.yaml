    Pin urllib3~=1.26.15 in logs-deploy.sh script. This fixes S3 upload timeout errors
    where the connection was timing out with "urllib3.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError" and 
    "botocore.exceptions.ReadTimeoutError" when uploading large log files to S3.
    
    The error occurs because newer urllib3 versions have incompatible timeout handling
    with boto3/botocore used for S3 uploads. This change makes logs-deploy.sh
    consistent with other scripts in global-jjb that already pin urllib3 to version 1.26.15.
