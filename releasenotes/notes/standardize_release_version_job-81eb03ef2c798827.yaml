    Using "releases" and "release" in different places is becoming confusing.
    Standardize to "release" to match lftools command and the majority of the
    exisiting wording.

    Use "releases" for the list of tech team releases and trggers since it is
    intuitive there. For example "releases/1.1.1.yaml"
