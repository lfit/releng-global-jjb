features:

    Created new function lf-activate-venv(). This function creates a venv in
    /tmp and prepends the bin directory to the PATH. The 'pip install' command
    now specifies: '--upgrade-strategy eager'. lf-activate-venv() supports an
    optional --python flag to specify which python to use to create the vevn,
    the default is to get the version from the JJB_VERSION environmental
    variable.

    Two new functions: lf-git-validate-jira-urls() and lf-jjb-check-ascii().
    They will be used to replace jjb-check-unicode.sh &
    git-validate-jira-urls.sh scripts at some point. For now, they are not being
    used.
other:

    The lf-venv-add(), lf-vevn-create() & lf-venv-activate functions have been
    removed. No-one is accessing it yet.
