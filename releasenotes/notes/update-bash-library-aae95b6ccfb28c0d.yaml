    The 'lf-venv-create()' functionality has changed. The 'venv' is created in
    '/tmp' and no-longer supports being shared. The 'lf-tmp-venv' variable will
    contain the path to the new venv. The 'lf-tmp-venv' variable is used by
    'lf-venv-activate()' function to set the PATH.

    For 'lf-venv-create(), the 'python' command argument on the command line is
    no longer supported. It has been replaced with the optional '--python
    python' flag. By default the venv will be created with 'python3'.

    The 'lf-venv-create()' allows a default version to be specified for a
    package. If a 'versioned' package is specified on the command line, the
    'version' directive will be appended when passing package 'pip install'. If
    a package version is specified on the command line, that will take
    precedence.  Currently the only versioned package is jenkins-job-builder. It
    defaults to 'JJB_VERSION' from the environment.

    Two new functions: lf-git-validate-jira-urls() and lf-check-unicode().  They
    will be used to replace jjb-check-unicode.sh & git-validate-jira-urls.sh
    scripts at some point. For now that are not being used.
fixes:
  - |
    The 'pip install' command now specifies: '--upgrade-strategy eager'.
other:
  - |
    The lf-venv-add() function has been removed. No-one is accessing it yet.
