features:
  - |
    Added new 'private' function '_lf-update-package-list()' that is used by
    lf-venv-create().
    Added support for efficiently calling lf-venv-create(). A package-list is
    kept of all packages that have been installed. If secondary calls to
    lf-venv-create() do not request any new packages, it will immediately
    return.
deprecatons:
  - |
    The lf-venv-add() function has been removed.
fixes:
  - |
    The 'pip install' command still generate version 'errors' (to sdterr) even
    though it does not return 'bad status'.  The 'pip install --update' command
    is called three times to get the versions of all the packages in sync. The
    first two calls to 'pip install --upgrade' redirect stderr to /dev/null. So
    if there are any version conflicts in the final 'pip install' they will be
    visible in the log.
