    Addresses failures when cleaning up orphaned openstack ports.
    The main "openstack <object> list" command no longer accepts
    the "-c created_at" option, which has been moved to a property
    of the object and must now be queried with "openstack show object
    UUID". Also, the created_at parameter sometimes returns "None"
    instead of a timestamp, and the existing version of the script
    does not catch this condition.
