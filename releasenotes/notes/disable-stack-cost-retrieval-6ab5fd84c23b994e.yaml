    **STOPGAP FIX:** Temporarily disable stack cost retrieval in
    openstack-stack-delete.sh to prevent jobs from hanging indefinitely.

    **Problem:** The lftools openstack stack cost command hangs without
    timeout handling when querying the pricing API or OpenStack resources,
    causing:

    - Jobs stuck at "Retrieving stack cost" phase
    - Subsequent jobs waiting on checkpoints
    - Jenkins queue buildup and capacity issues

    **Solution:** Stack cost is now hardcoded to 0 until lftools implements
    proper timeout handling for network operations.

    **Known Regression:** Stack costs will be reported as 0 in cost.csv
    files, losing cost tracking data for OpenStack resources. Instance-level
    costs from the pricing API are still collected via job-cost.sh.

    **Root Cause:** lftools lacks timeout parameters for urllib.request.urlopen()
    and OpenStack SDK operations in the stack cost calculation.

    **Tracking:**

    - Fixes: IT-28614 (Jobs hanging on stack cost retrieval)
    - Regression: Stack costs always reported as 0 (needs lftools fix)
    - Upstream: lftools needs timeout implementation for openstack stack cost command

    **Next Steps:** Once lftools implements timeouts, this workaround should
    be reverted to restore cost collection functionality.
