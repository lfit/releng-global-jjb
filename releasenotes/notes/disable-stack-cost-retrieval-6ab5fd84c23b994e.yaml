    Disable stack cost retrieval in openstack-stack-delete.sh to prevent
    jobs from hanging indefinitely. The lftools openstack stack cost command
    was causing timeouts without proper error handling, leading to stuck jobs
    and Jenkins capacity issues. Stack cost is now set to 0 while the underlying
    lftools timeout issue is being addressed.
