    Add sonar-project-file parameter to ci sonar jobs. By enabling the caller
    to override the default project file name with an empty string, we enable
    the ability to provide project settings directly in the sonar-properties
    field. This removes the requirement for a "sonar-project.properties" file
    in the repo.
