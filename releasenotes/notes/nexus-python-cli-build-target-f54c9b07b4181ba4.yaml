    Replace Nexus IQ build Target from "${REQUIREMENTS_FILE}" to "${NEXUS_TARGET_BUILD}".
    The scanner is only including the requirements.txt file in its scan which
    should not contain other information than python package requirements.
    Instead, use a "${NEXUS_TARGET_BUILD}" parameter which the user can optionally provide to
    the scanner to indicate a file or directory to include in the scan. By default, this
    variable is configured to scan all files in the repo.
