    New templates gerrit-sonar-prescan-script and github-sonar-prescan-script
    accept an arbitrary shell-script body that can do work like install
    prerequisites, build and test to generate a code-coverage report for
    the Sonar Scanner to find and upload.  This adds flexibility that the
    existing gerrit-sonar-prescan and github-sonar-prescan templates lack.
