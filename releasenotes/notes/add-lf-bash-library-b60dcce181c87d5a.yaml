    Add lf-env.sh 'library' script in ~jenkins. Sourcing this 'library' script
    from a bash script provides access to a number of functions. The script is
    installed by the 'init' script at boot time so that is is accessible from
    any Jenkins build script. Hopefully over time other functions will be added
    to this library.
