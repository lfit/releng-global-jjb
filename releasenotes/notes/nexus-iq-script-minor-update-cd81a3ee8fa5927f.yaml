    The Nexus IQ script was outputting the wrong variable during
    execution, which could be misleading in the job console logs. Also
    added a warning message if the NEXUS_TARGET_BUILD variable has not
    been set/populated. Reports were not receiving module dependencies
    so the script has been amended to download them into the target
    directory, as per the Nexus IQ documentation.
