    Fix zgrep pattern for verify_packagecloud_match_release function. Function
    was looking for "Successfully Uploaded" pattern, which is not the correct
    response when using packagecloud gem to push packages to packagecloud.

    Fix lf-release docs example to reflect changes to package_name. Package_name
    should not include the version in the name.
