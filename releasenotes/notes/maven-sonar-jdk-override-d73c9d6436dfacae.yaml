    Run Sonar scans using JDK11.
    *java-version* will only set java for the maven build part of the job,
    the sonar scan will use *sonarcloud-java-version* which is set to *openjdk11*.
    Projects not compatible with JDK11 will be able to run their build with
    *java-version* set to their JDK preference.
