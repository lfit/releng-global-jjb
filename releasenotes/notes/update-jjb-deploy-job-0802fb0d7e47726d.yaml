fixes:
  - |
    The jjb-deploy-job.sh was 'activating' a venv that was created by
    pip-install.sh in /tmp/v. This venv was based on python2. Now
    jjb-deploy-job.sh calls lf-activate-venv() to install jenkins-jobs in a
    venv based on python3.
upgrade:
  - |
    The lf-pip-install builder macro has been deleted. At some point we will
    also be deleting shell/pip-install.sh.
