fixes:

    jjb-deploy-job.sh was 'activating' a venv that was created by pip-install.sh
    in /tmp/v. This venv was based on python2. Now jjb-deploy-job.sh calls
    lf-activate-venv() to install jenkins-jobs in a venv based on python3.
deprecations:
  - |
    The lf-pip-install macro has been deleted. At some point we can also delete
    shell/pip-install.sh.
