    Allow projects to override Semantic Version (SemVer).

    It's recommended to use Semantic Versions (SemVer) for releases. Refer to
    https://semver.org for more details on SemVer. For projects that do not
    follow SemVer can use a job build parameter (OVERRIDE_SEMVER_REGEX) with the
    release job. This build param overrides the default SemVer regex.

    The default SemVer regex is taken from
    https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool.
