    Allow projects to override Semantic Version (SemVer).

    It's recommended to use Semantic Versions (SemVer) for releases. Refer to
    https://semver.org for more details on SemVer. In case the project does not
    support SemVer, then release job can use a build parameter to pass a regex
    that overrides the default SemVer regex in OVERIDE_SEMVER_REGEX.

    The default SemVer regex is taken from
    https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool.
