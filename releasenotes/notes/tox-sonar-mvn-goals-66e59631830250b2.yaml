    Use existing builder lf-infra-maven sonar, drop incomplete builder
    lf-tox-maven-sonar, to gain desired behavior of pushing code analysis
    results to Sonar.  Use trivial goal 'validate' by default.
    The script maven-sonar.sh calls maven twice, first with build goals
    and then with Sonar goals.  The incomplete builder did not supply 
    the build goals.
