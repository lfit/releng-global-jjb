    Pin urllib3 to <2.0.0 for the RTD jobs

    The latest version of module breaks compatibility with RTDv3
    jobs during tox install and run.

    Error:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ValueError: Timeout value connect was <object object at
       0x7fe57a4948a0>, but it must be an int, float or None.
