upgrade:
  - |
    Projects using gerrit-maven-docker-stage or github-maven-docker-stage
    will need to trigger the job by commenting "stage-docker-release".
fixes:
  - |
    Allow lf-maven-docker-stage jobs to be triggered by a unique gerrit or
    github comment.
    "stage-release" was triggering both lf-maven-docker-stage and lf-maven-stage
    but some LF projects need to trigger lf-maven-stage independently from
    lf-maven-docker-stage.
