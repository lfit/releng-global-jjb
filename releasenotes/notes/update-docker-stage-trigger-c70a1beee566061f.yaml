    Projects using gerrit-maven-docker-stage will need to trigger the job by
    commenting "stage-docker-release".
    Projects using github-maven-docker-stage will need to trigger the job by
    updating the PR request status context to "Docker Release" and phrase
    "build release"
fixes:
  - |
    Allow lf-maven-docker-stage jobs to be triggered by its own trigger word.
    "stage-release" triggers both lf-maven-docker-stage and lf-maven-stage but
    some projects need to build these independently.
