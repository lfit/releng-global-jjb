    New script has been added: scrape-job-cost. This script will be executed by
    cron as nexus on the Nexus Server for each project. It will extract cost
    data from the nexus directory for each Jenkins Builder (production &
    sandbox). The cost data for each builder will be appended to separate cost
    files located in ~nexus/cost on the nexus server. The files will be named
    sandbox-YYYY.csv and production-YYYY.csv.
