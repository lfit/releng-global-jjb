    Some ONAP projects make both maven and docker releases for a single repo.
    Docker releases depend on maven releases. This means that the team needs
    to make a maven release first, then make a docker release and lastly,
    tag the repo. This change will allow them to hold the tagging part during
    maven releases to allow them to tag after the docker release is made.
