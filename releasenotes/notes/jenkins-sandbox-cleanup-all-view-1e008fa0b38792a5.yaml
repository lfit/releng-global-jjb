    Requires JJB 2.8.0 for the jenkins-sandbox-cleanup job to not fail.

    .. note::

       Despite the failure if JJB 2.8.0 is not available the job will
       successfully delete all jobs and views, the primary purpose of this job.

    :ref:`RELENG-1450 <https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/browse/RELENG-1450>`_
    All view disappears on Jenkins Sandbox after views are deleted. The **All**
    view is now recreated after ``delete-all`` is run.
