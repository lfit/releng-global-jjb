fixes:
  - |
    Update echo commands in release-job.sh for consistency and easy identification.
  - |
    Update release-container-schema to require container_pull_registry and
    container_push_registry. These will be used to pull and push operations for self
    release containers. Provides future support for DockerHub releases.
