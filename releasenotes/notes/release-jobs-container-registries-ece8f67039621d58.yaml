upgrade:
  - |
    CONTAINER_PULL_REGISTRY and CONTAINER_PUSH_REGISTRY need to be
    defined in Jenkins global environment varaibles.
fixes:
  - |
    Update echo commands in release-job.sh for easy identification.
  - |
    Update release-container-schema to require CONTAINER_PULL_REGISTRY
    and CONTAINER_PUSH_REGISTRY. These will be used to pull and push
    operations for self release containers. Provides future support
    for DockerHub releases. These values are defined as global varaibles
    but can be overwritten in the releases files.
