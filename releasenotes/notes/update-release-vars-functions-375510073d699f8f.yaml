fixes:
  - |
    Release schema verification needs to happen first before we attempt to assign
    values to the variables.
  - |
    Organize variable setup into functions. Maven release files expects different
    variables than container release files.
  - |
    Rename "version" variable in container release files to "container_release_tag"
    which is a better user friendly name given the fact that container versions are
    rather called tags. Internally, we still process it as "version" to allow reuse
    of the tag function.
