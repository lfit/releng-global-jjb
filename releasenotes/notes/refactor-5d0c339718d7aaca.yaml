    Jobs using the **lf-maven-stage** macro now need to update to the new
    usage. Preparation calls to **lf-provide-maven-settings**,
    **lf-infra-create-netrc**, and **lf-provide-maven-settings-cleanup** are no
    longer necessary to prepare the **lf-maven-stage** macro.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - lf-maven-stage:
          mvn-global-settings: 'global-settings'
          mvn-settings: 'settings'
          mvn-staging-id: 'staging profile id'
