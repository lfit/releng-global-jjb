    Fix and cleanup release-job.sh. Optional step to prepare
    to push to Maven Central needs to be executed after fetching
    a releases yaml file. Avoids failing the job due to this
    variable appearing empty.
    Other fixes include rename local vars using lower caps,
    use echo logs similar to how we do in other scripts, Update
    comment information and Sort release information being
    displayed in the logs.
