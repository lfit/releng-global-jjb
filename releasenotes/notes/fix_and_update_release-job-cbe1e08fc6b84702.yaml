    Fix and cleanup release-job.sh.
    Optional step to prepare to push to Maven Central needs to be executed
    after fetching a releases/*.yaml file. Avoids failing the job due to this
    variable appearing empty.
    Rename local vars using lower caps.
    Use echo logs similar to how we do in other scripts.
    Update comment information.
    Sort release information being displayed in the logs.
