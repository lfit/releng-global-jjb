    Parallel jobs are now natively supported by tox since version 3.7.0
    thanks to the option "-p" / "--parallel".
    This new option offers more possibilities than detox and other options
    have also been introduced to tune tox behavior in parallel mode. This
    evolution allows more tox parallel mode configurations in yaml templates.
