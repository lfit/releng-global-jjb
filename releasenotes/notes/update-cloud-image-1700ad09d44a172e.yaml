    The update-cloud-images.sh script was using virtualenv to install openstack
    which fails because the latest version of openstack requires python3.  It
    fails quietly because that is no error handling in the script (all errors
    are ignored). The script now uses lf-activate-venv() and it runs with 'set
    -euo pipefail'.
