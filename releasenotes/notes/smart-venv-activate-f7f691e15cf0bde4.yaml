    Post-build script capture-instance-metadata.sh will attempt to choose the
    best possible version of Python to use. If the ``$PYTHON`` variable is set,
    this will be used. If not, we check to see if ``python3`` is available,
    as this should point to the latest version. If this is also not available,
    we run with the basic ``python`` command.
