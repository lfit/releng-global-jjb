    Replace deprecated ``sonar.login`` property with ``sonar.token`` in
    SonarCloud integration scripts. The ``sonar.login`` property has been
    deprecated by SonarCloud and will be removed in future versions.

    This change eliminates the following warning that appeared in job logs
    and SonarCloud analysis status pages:

    "The property 'sonar.login' is deprecated and will be removed in the
    future. Please use the 'sonar.token' property instead when passing a
    token."

    Affected scripts:

    * ``shell/maven-sonar.sh`` - Maven-based SonarCloud jobs
    * ``shell/cmake-sonar.sh`` - CMake-based SonarCloud jobs
