    Modify lf-activate-venv() to allow creation of a venv file and re-use the venv
    file to improve job performance. When a dependency is already installed pip will
    skip installing the same package in the venv which reduces the time it
    takes to create venv in every script.

    Add support for a new option to set venv file

    Ex: lf-activate-venv --venv-file /tmp/.robot_venv robotframework

    Precedence while creating a venv:
    a. Re-use an existing venv file if one exists:
      1. Use evnv file path from --venv-file
      2. Use default venv file path "/tmp/.os_lf_venv"
    b. Create new venv when 1. and 2. is absent

    Note: The default file "/tmp/.os_lf_venv" is created by a pre-build
    script (python-tools-install.sh).

    In situation where a fresh venv is required remove "/tmp/.os_lf_venv"
    before calling lf-activate-venv()

    Update all the required scripts to call lf-activate-venv()
