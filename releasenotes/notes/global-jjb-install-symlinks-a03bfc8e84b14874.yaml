    Global JJB now has non-JJB YAML configuration and requires action on the
    ci-management repo when upgrading to this version of Global JJB to prevent
    JJB from picking up these YAMLs as config. Follow the instructions below
    BEFORE upgrading globall-jjb:

    .. code-block:: bash
       cd <git-root>
       git mv jjb/global-jjb global-jjb
       mkdir jjb/global-jjb
       git add jjb/global-jjb
       git commit -sm "Prepare repo for global-jjb v0.25.0"
