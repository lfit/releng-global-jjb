prelude: >
  JJB's YAML parser is re-written in JJB 5.x release for a fine-tuned control
  over YAML parsing, YAML objects and parameter expansion logic.
issues:
  - |
    This breaks backward compatibility with older version of JJB
    therefore care must be taken during upgrade.
upgrade:
  - |
    Upgrade Jenkins-job-builder to 5.0.1 as the default version.
