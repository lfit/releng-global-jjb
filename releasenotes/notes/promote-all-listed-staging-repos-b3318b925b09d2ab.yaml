    The self-release jobs does not handle multiple repositories listed in
    staging-repo.txt file. This fixes the issue by deriving the NEXUS_URL
    and the STAGING_REPO from each entry in the file. This approach also
    eliminates the need for having multiple release.yaml files for every
    staging-repo.
