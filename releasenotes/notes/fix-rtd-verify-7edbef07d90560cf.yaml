    Remove dead code for rtd verify script. The script attempts to install
    lftools dev in --user and fails on the error.

    Using `--user` installs the python modules in
    ~/.local/lib/PYTHON_VERSION/site-packages which is not found.

    Error:

      [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python3.6'
