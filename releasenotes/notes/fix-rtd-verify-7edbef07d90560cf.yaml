    Fix the rtd verify script failure. The script attempts to install
    lftools dev with --user and fails on the error.

    Error:

      [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python3.6'

    This code is actually required when a new commands are added to lftools,
    the docs verify job needs to run the new command and install dev version
    lftools version.
