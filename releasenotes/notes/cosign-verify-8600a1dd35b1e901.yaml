    When a container release is checked, the job will also check for a cosign
    signature. This fixes an issue where a docker image could be successfully
    pushed, but cosign would fail. This would lead to a failed job, and upon
    re-running the job, it would pass when the container was found on the server,
    without ever checking the status of the signature.
