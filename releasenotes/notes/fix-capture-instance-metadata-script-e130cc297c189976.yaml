    Check condition when ${NOMAD_DC} is undefined or unset

    The condition in the commit 31a4b7fc00fe90494b6efb512ad0f1db02481ff3
    should instead check when the environment variable $NOMAD_DC is not
    defined or unset, this avoids the script from exiting without capturing
    instant metadata.
