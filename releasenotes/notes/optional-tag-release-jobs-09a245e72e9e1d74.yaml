    Allow projects to skip the tagging of the Gerrit repo. Set to "true"
    by default.
    There are cases where some projects build different artifacts within
    a pom.xml located in a subdirectory of a .git repo. In this case, the
    project wants to make separate releases for their different artifacts
    but only tag the repo once. Hence, allowing them to skip the tag part.
