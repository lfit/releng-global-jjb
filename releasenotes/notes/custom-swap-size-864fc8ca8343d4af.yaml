    Previously the swap size was fixed at 1GB.

    If env var SWAP_COUNT is set when the jenkins-init-scripts/init.sh script
    is called, it will be used to specify the swap size. If it is 'zero' then
    no swap space is created. The swap space is allocated with the 'dd'
    command. The SWAP_COUNT will be used in the 'count' switch. The 'bs'
    switch is set to 1M so a SWAP_COUNT of 1kB will result is a swap size of
    1G. See the 'dd' manual for more info.
