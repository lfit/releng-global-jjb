    setuptools 66.0.0 enforces specific version number check. A lot of plugins
    will fails on this, and generates the following error
    pkg_resources.extern.packaging.version.InvalidVersion: Invalid version: '1223.v7f1a_98a_8863e'

    To temporarily fix this, we pin setuptools to an earlier release
