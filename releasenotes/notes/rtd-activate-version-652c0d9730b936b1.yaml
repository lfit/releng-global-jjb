    Fixed logic for discovering new branches
    When a new branch exists on gerrit, but has never been seen by RTD
    we need to trigger a job so that the branch is discovered
    we can then mark it active in the following step.
    Logic was wrong in previous iteration.
    We need to explicitly match the returned string of "null"
