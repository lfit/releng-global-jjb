    Fix: Update CentOS 7 mirrorlist to vault

    With CentOS 7 being EOL the mirrorlist URLs are archived
    and moved to CentOS vault.

    This impacts Jenkins minions configuration required for
    Sigul signing.

    As a workaround force vault use in yum repos config
    till this is resolved and new version of sigul client/server
    is available to use on the infrastructure.
