    New ``lf-stack-create`` macro allows job-templates to setup a OpenStack
    Heat stack, useful for spinning up CSIT labs to run integration tests
    against. Use with the ``lf-stack-delete`` macro.

upgrade:
  - |
    ``lf-stack-delete`` has been modified to be a companion macro to
    ``lf-stack-create`` in order to cleanup the stack at the end of a job run.
    It now includes a required parameter **openstack-cloud** to choose the
    ``clouds.yaml`` cloud configuration for the project. Existing users of
    this macro will need to update their job templates accordingly.
