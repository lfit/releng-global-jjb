    Check for the presense of an existing venv ("/tmp/.os_lf_venv")
    into the lf-activate-venv() for the openstack dependencies which
    makes the code look cleaner to maintain.

    The file "/tmp/.os_lf_venv" is only created by python-tools-install.sh
    which is called during pre-build.

    If the dependency is already installed pip will skip installing the
    package.
