    Update the sigul-sign-dir.sh to sign artifacts using docker. The docker
    image is built on CentOS Streams 8/9. The newer version of sigul 1.1.1
    available for CentOS 8 is not backwords compatible with the version of
    sigul on CentOS 7.

    As a temporary workaround build a CentOS7 docker image with sigul
    installed and use it for signing artificats on platforms where sigul is
    not readly available.
