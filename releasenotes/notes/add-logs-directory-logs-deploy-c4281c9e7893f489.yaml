    Add "logs" prefix to s3_path(s3_path="logs/$SILO/$JENKINS_HOSTNAME\
                                          /$JOB_NAME/$BUILD_NUMBER/")
    We are not allowed to have an index.html file at the root level of the
    S3 bucket. Adding the additional prefix allows us to mirror the directory
    structure of Nexus where you are able to see both production and sandbox
    logs when browsing to https://logs.<project>.org/.
