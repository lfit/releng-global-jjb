    Add "logs" prefix to s3_path("logs/$SILO/$JENKINS_HOSTNAME/$JOB_NAME/
    $BUILD_NUMBER/"). We are not allowed to have an index.html file at the root
    level of the S3 bucket. Adding the additional prefix allows us to mirror the
    directory structure of Nexus where you are able to see both production and
    sandbox logs when browsing to https://logs.<project>.org/.
