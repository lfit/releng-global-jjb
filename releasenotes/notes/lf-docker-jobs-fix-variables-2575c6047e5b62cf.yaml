    When calling builder step macros "lf-docker-get-container-tag",
    "lf-docker-build" and "lf-docker-push", make sure the needed varaibales
    are also passed explicitly to avoid these variables appear as undefined.

    Modify scripts to fix variable convention. Remove push regisrty and use
    if only after docker-push.sh is called.
