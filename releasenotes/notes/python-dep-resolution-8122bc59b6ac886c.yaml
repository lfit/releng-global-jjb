    Change pip's upgrade-strategy to "eager" for python-tools-install.sh.
    Pip changed its default upgrade-strategy to "only-if-required", which
    is not correctly upgrading requests (and potentially other packages
    in the future) to meet other packages' requirements. This results in
    errors in the build log. By using the upgrade-strategy "eager", pip
    is able to properly install what is needed.
