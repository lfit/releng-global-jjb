    ``lf-jacoco-report`` publisher now uses the ``exclude-pattern`` variable to set
    the exclusion pattern. Any job implementing this publisher needs to define
    this variable.

    Additionally, all ``lf-maven`` job templates that utilize the ``lf-jacoco-report``
    publisher define the exclusion pattern with the variable ``jacoco-exclude-pattern``.
    This can be overwritten by the calling project definition/template in order
    to set a custom exclusion pattern.
