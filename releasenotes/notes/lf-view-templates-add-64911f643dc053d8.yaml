    New view-templates ``project-view``, ``common-view``, and ``csit-view`` are
    available for projects to manage Jenkins views through code.

    To use the ``project-view`` template in a project:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - project:
           name: aaa-view
           views:
             - project-view

           project-name: aaa

    To use the ``common-view`` template in a project:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - project:
           name: daily-builds
           views:
             - common-view

           view-name: Periodic
           view-regex: '.*-periodic-.*'

    To use the ``csit-view`` template in a project:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - project:
           name: csit
           views:
             - csit-view

           view-name: CSIT
           view-regex: '.*csit.*'

       - project:
           name: csit-1node
           views:
             - csit-view

           view-name: CSIT-1node
           view-regex: '.*-csit-1node-.*'

upgrade:
  - |
    Some LF projects are already using a ``common-view`` template in their
    local ci-management repo. This ``common-view`` is called ``project-view``
    in global-jjb so rename all instances of ``common-view`` to
    ``project-view`` when upgrading and remove the local ``common-view``
    view-template definition from ci-management.
