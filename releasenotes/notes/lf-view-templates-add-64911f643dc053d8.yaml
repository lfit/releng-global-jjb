    New view-templates ``common-view`` and ``integration-csit-view`` are
    available for projects to manage Jenkins views through code.

    To use the ``common-view`` template in a project.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - project:
           ...
           views:
             - common-view

    To use the ``integration-csit-view`` template in a project.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - project:
           ...
           views:
             - integration-csit-view

    A separate project section can be defined for views that are common to a
    set of jobs. This creates a list-type view with ``<project-name>`` in
    Jenkins which lists all the jobs under the view.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       - project:
           name: <project-name-view>
           project: <project>
           project-name: <project-name>
           views:
             - common-view

    Example Usage:

    .. code-block:: yaml
