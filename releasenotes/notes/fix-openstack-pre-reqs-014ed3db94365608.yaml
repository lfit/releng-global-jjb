    Use lf-activate-venv to install openstack deps

    Using python-tools-install.sh for the pre/post build is not recommended
    approach for installing python dependencies since this installs the
    dependencies with `--user` option (removed in I821a86ac3b54f284e8).

    Instead use lf-activate-venv to setup an venv and pull in the required
    dependencies.
