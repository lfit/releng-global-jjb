    New templates gerrit-tox-sonarqube and github-tox-sonarqube
    use the SonarQube Jenkins plug-in to analyze Python code and
    publish the results.  Modeled after the generic gerrit/github-sonar
    templates. The new templates eliminate the need for mvn-settings in
    the job configuration and the need for a pom.xml file in the repo.
