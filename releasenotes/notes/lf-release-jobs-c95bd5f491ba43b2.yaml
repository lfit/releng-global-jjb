    The release merge job is a one way operation.
    Given this, Release jobs should only exist in the format
    {project-name}-release-verify and
    {project-name}-release-merge
    As these jobs trigger from a change to any branch/**
    These jobs Must Exit 0 if release job has already tagged a repo.
    Inevitably a release file will be pulled in from master to branch
    or a remerge will be requested This will again trigger the release jobs.
    since in this case the repo is already tagged, the job should not report
    a failure. This is solved by having the verfiy and merge exit 0 when the
    repo is already tagged
