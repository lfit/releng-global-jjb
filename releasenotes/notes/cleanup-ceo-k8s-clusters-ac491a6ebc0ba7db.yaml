    Process orphaned coe clusters for K8S jobs

    K8s (COE cluster) jobs by default creates stacks names that does not match
    JOB_NAME, therefore ignore them while processing orphaned stacks and handle
    them separatly when cleaning up the orphaned clusters.

    The stack naming scheme is limited to take first 20 chars from the JOB_NAME
    while the rest is randomly generated for uniqueness:

    This breaks the openstack cron jobs.
