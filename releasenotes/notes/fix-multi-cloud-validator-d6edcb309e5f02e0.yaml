    Multi-cloud image validation was not properly working as we force set the
    OS_CLOUD environment variable before validation of images. This has been
    rectified to dynamicaly modify the OS_CLOUD variable based upon the
    cloud.cfg that will be used to define the cloud in Jenkins.

    We now validate that a cloud.cfg file exists for any defined OpenStack
    cloud.
