    New templates gerrit-cmake-packagecloud-stage and
    github-cmake-packagecloud-stage for building DEB/RPM package
    files and publishing them to a PackageCloud.io repository on
    posted comment.  Adds builder macros lf-packagecloud-file-provider
    and lf-packagecloud-push.  Adds script packagecloud-push.sh to
    call Ruby gem package_cloud.
    The new templates are lifted from the ORAN project.
