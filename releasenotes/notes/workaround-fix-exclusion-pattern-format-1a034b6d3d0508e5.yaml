    Fix JaCoCo exclude patterns format. JJB 6.x does not process
    the job config when double quotes are used and returns the
    following error.

    Error:
    requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 500 Server Error: Server Error for url:
    https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/job/distribution-\
    merge-managed-argon/config.xml

    Using YAML multiline introduces spaces between lines that causes JJB
    updates to fail when the job exists on Jenkins. Therefore, as workaround
    use double-quoted string with newline escape.
