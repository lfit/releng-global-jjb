upgrade:
  - |
    This change requires creation of a custom managed file (ansible.cfg)
    on the Jenkins environment with the default line
    "remote_src = ~/.ansible/tmp".
features:
  - |
    Add packer builder macros to create a 'ansible.cfg' file.
    This is required by packer build jobs to set ansible host
    configuration. The job or image specific configuration can be created
    using JCasC custom files in the ci-man repository.

    Example configuration:
    https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.11/examples/ansible.cfg
