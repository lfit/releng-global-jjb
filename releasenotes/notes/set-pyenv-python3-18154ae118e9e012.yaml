    Use pyenv whih is the standard way to manage, set and use a python3
    installation on the system.

    The required version of python3 for all jobs should be > 3.8.x, to
    avoid PyPI dependencies conflicts with outdated versions. However, the
    lf-activate-env() uses the system default version python installed through
    packages. This can cause warning and build failures that source lf-env.sh.

    Update lf-activate-env to use pyenv versions of python3 installed through
    the lfit.python-install galaxy ansible role.
